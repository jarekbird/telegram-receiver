# PHASE3-017: Review callback patterns and avoid callback hell

**Section**: 3. Node.js Best Practices
**Subsection**: 3.3
**Task ID**: PHASE3-017

## Description

Review and improve callback-based async patterns in the codebase to identify and eliminate callback hell. This task focuses specifically on Node.js callback conventions (error-first callbacks), nested callback patterns, and converting callback-based APIs to Promises or async/await. This complements PHASE3-005 (async/await and Promise patterns) and PHASE3-016 (error handling) by focusing on the specific anti-pattern of callback hell.

## Context

This task is distinct from:

- **PHASE3-005**: Reviews async/await and Promise patterns broadly (already converted code)
- **PHASE3-016**: Reviews error handling patterns (error objects, try-catch, etc.)
- **PHASE3-017**: Focuses specifically on **callback-based patterns** and **callback hell**

Callback hell occurs when callbacks are nested deeply, making code hard to read and maintain:

```typescript
// Bad: Callback hell
fs.readFile('file1.txt', (err1, data1) => {
  if (err1) throw err1;
  fs.readFile('file2.txt', (err2, data2) => {
    if (err2) throw err2;
    fs.readFile('file3.txt', (err3, data3) => {
      if (err3) throw err3;
      // Process all three files...
    });
  });
});
```

## Architecture Reference

Reference the planned architecture from:

- `Plan/app-description.md` - Application overview and component descriptions
- `Plan/CONVERSION_STEPS.md` - Conversion plan and architecture considerations
- `docs/architecture.md` - Architecture documentation and async patterns
- `src/` directory structure - Current implementation structure

The application uses:

- **Express.js** - May use callback-based middleware patterns
- **Redis/ioredis** - May have callback-based methods
- **BullMQ** - Queue system that uses Promises/async-await
- **Axios** - Promise-based HTTP client
- **File system operations** - May use fs callbacks
- **Stream operations** - May use event-based callbacks

## Node.js Callback Patterns

### Error-First Callback Convention

Node.js follows the error-first callback convention:

```typescript
function callback(error: Error | null, result?: T): void {
  if (error) {
    // Handle error
  } else {
    // Handle result
  }
}
```

### Common Callback-Based APIs

1. **fs module** - File system operations (fs.readFile, fs.writeFile, etc.)
2. **Stream operations** - Event-based callbacks (on('data'), on('error'))
3. **Legacy Redis clients** - Callback-based methods
4. **Express middleware** - Some middleware uses callbacks
5. **Database drivers** - Some older drivers use callbacks

## Best Practices

1. **Prefer Promises/async-await**: Use Promises or async/await instead of callbacks when possible
2. **Use util.promisify**: For Node.js built-in APIs, use `util.promisify()` to convert callbacks to Promises
3. **Avoid deep nesting**: Keep callback nesting to ≤ 2 levels
4. **Consistent error handling**: Follow error-first callback convention when callbacks are necessary
5. **Parallelize independent operations**: Use Promise.all() instead of sequential callbacks
6. **Stream handling**: Consider async iterators for stream operations instead of event callbacks

## Examples

### Bad: Callback Hell

```typescript
// Deeply nested callbacks
fs.readFile('config.json', (err1, config) => {
  if (err1) throw err1;
  const settings = JSON.parse(config);
  db.connect(settings.db, (err2, connection) => {
    if (err2) throw err2;
    connection.query('SELECT * FROM users', (err3, users) => {
      if (err3) throw err3;
      processUsers(users, (err4, result) => {
        if (err4) throw err4;
        // Finally done...
      });
    });
  });
});
```

### Good: Async/Await

```typescript
// Converted to async/await
async function processData() {
  try {
    const config = await fs.promises.readFile('config.json', 'utf-8');
    const settings = JSON.parse(config);
    const connection = await db.connect(settings.db);
    const users = await connection.query('SELECT * FROM users');
    const result = await processUsers(users);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Promisification Example

```typescript
import { promisify } from 'util';
import * as fs from 'fs';

// Convert callback-based API to Promise
const readFile = promisify(fs.readFile);

// Now can use with async/await
const data = await readFile('file.txt', 'utf-8');
```

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 3. Node.js Best Practices
- Focus specifically on **callback patterns** and **callback hell**, not general async/await patterns (see PHASE3-005)
- Review actual implementation files in `src/` directory
- Compare callback patterns with Node.js best practices
- Document findings with specific file locations and line numbers
- Reference async/await patterns from PHASE3-005 and error handling from PHASE3-016
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
