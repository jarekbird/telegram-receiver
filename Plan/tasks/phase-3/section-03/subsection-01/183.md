# PHASE3-015: Review Node.js style guide compliance

**Section**: 3. Node.js Best Practices
**Subsection**: 3.1
**Task ID**: PHASE3-015

## Description

Review and improve Node.js style guide compliance in the codebase to ensure best practices. The codebase uses ESLint (`.eslintrc.json`) and Prettier (`.prettierrc.json`) for code style enforcement. This task involves reviewing the codebase against these configured rules and common Node.js/TypeScript style guide standards.

## Style Guide References

The codebase follows these style guide configurations:

- **ESLint Configuration**: `.eslintrc.json` - Uses TypeScript ESLint recommended rules with Prettier integration
- **Prettier Configuration**: `.prettierrc.json` - Enforces consistent code formatting
- **TypeScript Configuration**: `tsconfig.json` - Enforces strict TypeScript rules

Common Node.js style guide standards to reference:

- Node.js Style Guide (https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide)
- TypeScript Style Guide best practices
- ESLint recommended rules for Node.js
- Airbnb JavaScript/TypeScript Style Guide (as reference)

## Checklist

- [ ] Run ESLint (`npm run lint`) and review all warnings/errors
  - Note: ESLint checks both `src/` and `tests/` directories
  - Review all warnings, even if they're in test files
- [ ] Run Prettier format check (`npm run format:check`) and verify compliance
  - Checks both `src/` and `tests/` directories
- [ ] Review code against configured ESLint rules in `.eslintrc.json`
- [ ] Check naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/types)
  - Review both source code and test files
- [ ] Review file organization and directory structure consistency
- [ ] Check module patterns (ES modules vs CommonJS, import/export usage)
- [ ] Review error handling patterns (try/catch, error types, error propagation)
- [ ] Check TypeScript type usage (avoid `any`, proper type definitions)
  - Note: Generic utility functions in test helpers may legitimately use `any` for type parameters
  - Document acceptable exceptions vs violations
- [ ] Review async/await patterns and Promise handling
- [ ] Check console.log usage (should use console.warn/error or proper logging)
  - Verify no `console.log` statements exist in source code
  - Check that only `console.warn` and `console.error` are used if needed
- [ ] Review code comments and JSDoc documentation
- [ ] Check for unused variables/imports (enforced by TypeScript strict mode)
- [ ] Verify consistent code formatting (semicolons, quotes, indentation)
- [ ] Review test files for style guide compliance
  - Test utilities, mocks, fixtures, and test cases should follow same style standards
- [ ] Identify style guide violations and document them
  - Include file path, line number, rule violated, and severity
- [ ] Create a report of findings with specific file locations and line numbers
  - Categorize findings by severity (error, warning, suggestion)
  - Include examples of violations
- [ ] Propose fixes for identified violations
  - Prioritize auto-fixable issues (use `npm run lint:fix` and `npm run format`)
  - Document manual fixes needed
- [ ] Update ESLint/Prettier config if needed to align with best practices
  - Document any config changes and rationale

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 3. Node.js Best Practices
- Focus on identifying issues and improvements
- Document findings and decisions with specific examples
- Use `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` to identify violations
- Fix auto-fixable issues using `npm run lint:fix` and `npm run format`
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Scope**: Review both `src/` and `tests/` directories for style guide compliance
- **Current State**: As of evaluation, ESLint reports 2 warnings about `any` types in `tests/helpers/testUtils.ts` (line 15) - these may be acceptable for generic test utility functions
- **Expected Deliverable**: A comprehensive report documenting all style guide violations, categorized by severity, with specific file locations and proposed fixes

## Related Tasks

- Previous: PHASE3-014
- Next: PHASE3-016

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
