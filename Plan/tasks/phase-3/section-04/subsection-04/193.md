# PHASE3-025: Review import/export patterns

**Section**: 4. Code Organization
**Subsection**: 4.4
**Task ID**: PHASE3-025

## Description

Review and improve import/export patterns in the codebase to ensure best practices and consistency across all TypeScript files.

## Checklist

- [ ] Review import statements across all TypeScript files (src/, tests/, config files)
  - [ ] Check for consistent use of `import type` vs regular `import` for type-only imports
  - [ ] Verify proper use of default vs named imports
  - [ ] Check for correct use of path aliases (`@/` as configured in jest.config.ts)
  - [ ] Verify relative import paths are correct and consistent
- [ ] Check for unused imports
  - [ ] Run ESLint to identify unused imports
  - [ ] Remove any unused imports found
- [ ] Review export patterns
  - [ ] Check consistency between `export default` and named exports
  - [ ] Verify exports match their usage patterns
  - [ ] Review if default exports are appropriate or should be named exports
- [ ] Check for barrel exports (index.ts files that re-export from multiple modules)
  - [ ] Identify if barrel exports exist or should be created
  - [ ] Evaluate if barrel exports improve or complicate the import structure
- [ ] Review import order and grouping
  - [ ] Check if imports follow a consistent order (external packages, internal modules, types)
  - [ ] Verify grouping of imports (external, internal, relative, type-only)
  - [ ] Consider adding ESLint rules for import ordering if needed
- [ ] Check for consistent patterns across different file types
  - [ ] Test files (tests/\*_/_.ts)
  - [ ] Configuration files (jest.config.ts, playwright.config.ts)
  - [ ] Source files (src/\*_/_.ts) - when they exist
- [ ] Review path alias usage
  - [ ] Verify `@/` alias is used consistently where configured
  - [ ] Check if path aliases should be extended to tsconfig.json for runtime use
- [ ] Identify improvements and document recommendations
  - [ ] Document any inconsistencies found
  - [ ] Propose standard patterns for the codebase
  - [ ] Consider adding ESLint plugins for import organization (e.g., eslint-plugin-import)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 4. Code Organization
- Focus on identifying issues and improvements
- Document findings and decisions
- Current codebase state: Most TypeScript files are in `tests/` directory; `src/` directory is mostly empty but structure exists
- Path aliases: Jest config uses `@/` mapping to `src/` - verify if this should be extended to tsconfig.json for runtime use. Currently no files use the `@/` alias.
- ESLint configuration: Currently doesn't include import-specific rules - consider adding eslint-plugin-import (not currently installed)
- Current import patterns: All imports are from external packages (no internal/relative imports yet since src/ is mostly empty)
- Current export patterns: Config files use `export default`, test utilities use named exports

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
