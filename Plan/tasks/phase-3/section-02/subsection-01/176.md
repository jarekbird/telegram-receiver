# PHASE3-008: Review type definitions throughout codebase

**Section**: 2. TypeScript Best Practices
**Subsection**: 2.1
**Task ID**: PHASE3-008

## Description

Review and improve type definitions throughout the codebase to ensure TypeScript best practices. This includes reviewing interfaces, types, enums, and class definitions across all source files, identifying areas where type safety can be improved, and ensuring consistent type usage patterns.

**Current Codebase State**: As of this review, the codebase is in early stages. Most source directories (`src/controllers`, `src/services`, `src/models`, etc.) contain only `.gitkeep` files and are empty. The main focus should be on reviewing existing test files, configuration files, and establishing type patterns for future development.

## Checklist

### Current Files (Immediate Focus)

- [ ] Review test files (`tests/**/*.ts`) for type safety issues
  - [ ] `tests/helpers/testUtils.ts` - Replace `any` types in `createMockFn` generic constraints
  - [ ] `tests/mocks/telegramApi.ts` - Add proper TypeScript interfaces for mock return types
  - [ ] `tests/mocks/redis.ts` - Add proper TypeScript interfaces for Redis mock methods
  - [ ] `tests/mocks/cursorRunnerApi.ts` - Add proper TypeScript interfaces for API mock responses
  - [ ] `tests/fixtures/apiResponses.ts` - Add TypeScript interfaces for response fixtures
  - [ ] `tests/fixtures/telegramMessages.ts` - Add TypeScript interfaces for Telegram message fixtures
  - [ ] `tests/helpers/apiHelpers.ts` - Review and improve type definitions
- [ ] Review configuration files for type safety
  - [ ] `jest.config.ts` - Verify proper typing (already uses `Config` type)
  - [ ] `playwright.config.ts` - Verify proper typing (already uses `defineConfig`)
- [ ] Review `src/index.ts` (currently empty, but verify when implemented)

### Future Files (When Source Code is Added)

- [ ] Review all type definition files (`src/types/**/*.ts`, `*.d.ts` files) when they exist
- [ ] Review type definitions in source files (`src/**/*.ts`) as they are created
- [ ] Check for `any` types and replace with proper types where possible
- [ ] Check for missing return types on functions and methods
- [ ] Check for missing parameter types
- [ ] Review type completeness (ensure all properties are typed)
- [ ] Check for type duplication (consolidate duplicate type definitions)
- [ ] Review interface vs type alias usage (prefer interfaces for object shapes, types for unions/intersections)
- [ ] Check for proper generic type usage
- [ ] Verify type inference is working correctly (avoid unnecessary type annotations)
- [ ] Review type exports (ensure types are properly exported where needed)
- [ ] Check for unused type definitions

### Documentation

- [ ] Identify type improvements and document rationale
- [ ] Document findings and decisions in task notes
- [ ] Create type definition templates/patterns for future source files

## Areas to Focus On

### 1. Test Files (`tests/` directory) - **PRIMARY FOCUS**

- **Current Issues Found**:
  - `tests/helpers/testUtils.ts`: Uses `any` in `createMockFn` generic constraint (line 15)
  - Mock files lack proper TypeScript interfaces for return types
  - Fixture files use plain objects without type definitions
- **Actions Required**:
  - Create interfaces for Telegram API types (messages, updates, webhooks)
  - Create interfaces for Cursor Runner API types (requests, responses)
  - Create interfaces for Redis client mock types
  - Add proper types to all fixture functions
  - Replace `any` types with proper generics or `unknown` with type guards

### 2. Configuration Files - **SECONDARY FOCUS**

- `jest.config.ts`: Already properly typed with `Config` type from Jest
- `playwright.config.ts`: Already properly typed with `defineConfig`
- Consider creating environment variable type definitions when needed

### 3. Source Files (`src/` directory) - **FUTURE FOCUS**

- **Note**: Most source directories are currently empty (only `.gitkeep` files)
- When source files are created, ensure:
  - Controllers, services, models, middleware, routes have explicit types
  - All function parameters and return types are explicitly typed
  - Proper interface definitions for API requests/responses
  - Model types match database schemas

### 4. Type Definition Files (`src/types/` directory) - **FUTURE FOCUS**

- **Note**: Directory exists but is currently empty
- When type files are created, ensure:
  - All exported types and interfaces are properly organized
  - Types are documented with JSDoc comments
  - Type reusability and composition are considered
  - Shared types are exported from a central location

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 2. TypeScript Best Practices
- **Current State**: Codebase is in early stages - most source files don't exist yet
- **Immediate Priority**: Focus on improving types in existing test files and establishing patterns
- Focus on identifying issues and improvements
- Document findings and decisions
- When replacing `any` types, consider:
  - Using `unknown` for truly unknown types (requires type guards)
  - Creating specific interfaces/types for object shapes
  - Using generics for reusable type patterns
  - Using union types for multiple possible types
- **Specific Issues to Address**:
  - `tests/helpers/testUtils.ts` line 15: `createMockFn` uses `any[]` and `any` - should use proper generics
  - Mock files need proper TypeScript interfaces for their return types
  - Fixture files should have explicit type definitions
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Future Considerations**: As source files are added, ensure they follow the type patterns established in this review

## Related Tasks

- Next: PHASE3-009

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
