# PHASE3-009: Review interface/type usage patterns

**Section**: 2. TypeScript Best Practices
**Subsection**: 2.2
**Task ID**: PHASE3-009

## Description

Review and improve interface/type usage patterns in the codebase to ensure best practices. Establish consistent patterns for when to use `interface` vs `type`, create missing type definitions for API responses and test fixtures, and ensure type safety throughout the codebase.

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Found:

1. **Missing Type Definitions**: Test fixtures (`telegramMessages.ts`, `apiResponses.ts`) use plain objects without type definitions
2. **No API Response Types**: Telegram API and Cursor Runner API responses lack type definitions
3. **Missing Interface Definitions**: Mock objects (`telegramApi.ts`, `cursorRunnerApi.ts`, `redis.ts`) lack proper interface definitions
4. **Inconsistent Patterns**: Some files use generics (`testUtils.ts`), some use `as const` (`apiHelpers.ts`), but no consistent pattern
5. **No Type Safety**: Test fixtures can have any shape, making refactoring risky

### Existing Patterns:

- Generic types used in `testUtils.ts` for mock functions: `<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>`
- `as const` used in `apiHelpers.ts` for HTTP_STATUS constant
- No interfaces or type aliases currently defined in the codebase

## Checklist

### 1. Establish Interface vs Type Guidelines

- [ ] Document when to use `interface` vs `type`:
  - Use `interface` for object shapes that may be extended or implemented
  - Use `type` for unions, intersections, primitives, and computed types
  - Use `interface` for public APIs and contracts
  - Use `type` for internal type aliases and complex compositions
- [ ] Create a style guide document in `docs/typescript-patterns.md`

### 2. Create Missing Type Definitions

- [ ] Create Telegram API types in `src/types/telegram.ts`:
  - `TelegramUpdate`, `TelegramMessage`, `TelegramUser`, `TelegramChat`, `TelegramCallbackQuery`
  - `TelegramApiResponse<T>`, `TelegramSendMessageResponse`
- [ ] Create Cursor Runner API types in `src/types/cursorRunner.ts`:
  - `CursorRunnerResponse<T>`, `CursorRunnerIterateResponse`, `CursorRunnerAsyncResponse`
- [ ] Create Redis client types in `src/types/redis.ts`:
  - `RedisClient` interface extending the Redis client methods
- [ ] Create HTTP/API types in `src/types/api.ts`:
  - `ApiResponse<T>`, `ApiError`, `HttpStatusCode`

### 3. Update Test Fixtures with Types

- [ ] Update `tests/fixtures/telegramMessages.ts` to use proper types:
  - Replace plain objects with typed constants
  - Use `satisfies` operator for type checking without widening
- [ ] Update `tests/fixtures/apiResponses.ts` to use proper types
- [ ] Update `tests/mocks/telegramApi.ts` to implement `TelegramApi` interface
- [ ] Update `tests/mocks/cursorRunnerApi.ts` to implement `CursorRunnerApi` interface
- [ ] Update `tests/mocks/redis.ts` to implement `RedisClient` interface

### 4. Review and Improve Existing Patterns

- [ ] Review generic usage in `testUtils.ts`:
  - Ensure generic constraints are appropriate
  - Consider if utility types (`Parameters`, `ReturnType`) could be used
- [ ] Review `as const` usage in `apiHelpers.ts`:
  - Verify that `as const` is used appropriately for readonly constants
  - Consider if `satisfies` operator would be better in some cases
- [ ] Check for any `any` types and replace with proper types
- [ ] Review type inference opportunities

### 5. Establish Naming Conventions

- [ ] Document naming conventions:
  - Interfaces: PascalCase, descriptive names (e.g., `TelegramMessage`, `ApiResponse`)
  - Types: PascalCase, descriptive names (e.g., `HttpMethod`, `ApiErrorCode`)
  - Generic parameters: Single uppercase letters (e.g., `T`, `K`, `V`)
- [ ] Ensure all type definitions follow conventions

### 6. Review Type Composition Patterns

- [ ] Check for opportunities to use utility types:
  - `Partial<T>`, `Required<T>`, `Pick<T, K>`, `Omit<T, K>`
  - `Record<K, V>`, `Readonly<T>`, `NonNullable<T>`
- [ ] Review union and intersection types for appropriateness
- [ ] Check for type guards and discriminated unions where applicable

### 7. Documentation and Examples

- [ ] Document type patterns in `docs/typescript-patterns.md`
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all public type definitions
- [ ] Create examples showing proper usage of interfaces vs types
- [ ] Document any architectural decisions regarding type definitions

## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Use `interface`:

- Object shapes that represent contracts or APIs
- Types that may be extended or implemented
- Public API definitions
- Example: `interface TelegramMessage { ... }`

### When to Use `type`:

- Union types: `type HttpMethod = 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE'`
- Intersection types: `type A & B`
- Mapped types and utility type compositions
- Type aliases for complex types
- Example: `type ApiResponse<T> = { success: boolean; data: T }`

### Best Practices:

- Prefer `interface` for object shapes that may be extended
- Use `type` for unions, intersections, and computed types
- Use `satisfies` operator for type checking without type widening
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` and type guards instead
- Use generic constraints appropriately
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 2. TypeScript Best Practices
- Focus on establishing patterns early before more code is written
- All type definitions should be placed in `src/types/` directory
- Test fixtures should use proper types for better refactoring safety
- Document all decisions and patterns for future reference

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
