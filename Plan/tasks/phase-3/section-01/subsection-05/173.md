# PHASE3-005: Review async/await patterns and Promise handling

**Section**: 1. Architecture Review
**Subsection**: 1.5
**Task ID**: PHASE3-005

## Description

Review and improve async/await patterns and Promise handling in the codebase to ensure best practices. This review should evaluate how asynchronous operations are handled across all layers (controllers, services, jobs, middleware), verify consistent async/await usage, check for proper Promise handling, identify opportunities for parallelization, and ensure proper error handling in async contexts.

## Architecture Reference

Reference the planned architecture from:

- `Plan/app-description.md` - Application overview and component descriptions
- `Plan/CONVERSION_STEPS.md` - Conversion plan and architecture considerations
- `src/` directory structure - Current implementation structure

The application follows a layered architecture with:

- **Controllers** (`src/controllers/`) - HTTP request handling and routing
- **Services** (`src/services/`) - Business logic and external API integration
- **Models** (`src/models/`) - Data models and database interactions
- **Routes** (`src/routes/`) - Route definitions and middleware
- **Middleware** (`src/middleware/`) - Request processing middleware
- **Jobs** - Background job processing (BullMQ)
- **Utils** (`src/utils/`) - Utility functions and helpers
- **Types** (`src/types/`) - TypeScript type definitions

## Rails Async Patterns (Reference)

The jarek-va Rails application uses synchronous operations that need to be converted to async/await in Node.js/TypeScript:

### Background Jobs (Sidekiq → BullMQ)

- **TelegramMessageJob** (`jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb`): Processes updates asynchronously via Sidekiq
  - Rails: `TelegramMessageJob.perform_later(update)` - enqueues job
  - Node.js: Should use BullMQ job queue with async processors
  - Job methods should be async functions
  - Sequential operations (download → transcribe → send) should use async/await

### Service Operations

- **TelegramService** (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`): Synchronous HTTP calls
  - Rails: Uses `bot.api.send_message()` synchronously
  - Node.js: Should use async/await for HTTP requests
  - File downloads (`download_file`) should be async with proper cleanup
  - Multiple API calls should be parallelized where possible

- **CursorRunnerService** (`jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb`): Synchronous HTTP calls
  - Rails: Uses `Net::HTTP` synchronously with timeouts
  - Node.js: Should use async HTTP client (axios/fetch) with async/await
  - Timeout handling should use Promise.race() or AbortController
  - Error handling should propagate async errors properly

### Sequential Operations

- **TelegramMessageJob.transcribe_audio**: Sequential operations (download → transcribe → cleanup)
  - Rails: Uses `ensure` blocks for cleanup
  - Node.js: Should use `try/finally` with async cleanup
  - File operations should be async (fs.promises)

- **TelegramMessageJob.send_text_as_audio**: Sequential operations (synthesize → send → cleanup)
  - Rails: Uses `ensure` blocks for cleanup
  - Node.js: Should use `try/finally` with async cleanup
  - Error handling should handle cleanup errors gracefully

### Resource Cleanup

- Rails uses `ensure` blocks for cleanup (file deletion, connection closing)
- Node.js should use `try/finally` with async cleanup operations
- Cleanup errors should be logged but not fail the operation

## Async/Await Best Practices

In Node.js/TypeScript applications, async/await patterns should follow these best practices:

1. **Prefer async/await over Promise chains**: Use async/await for better readability and error handling
2. **Consistent Error Handling**: Always use try/catch with async/await or .catch() with Promises
3. **Avoid Promise Anti-patterns**: Don't mix async/await with Promise chains unnecessarily
4. **Parallel Execution**: Use Promise.all() for independent parallel operations
5. **Sequential Execution**: Use await in loops only when operations depend on each other
6. **Error Propagation**: Let errors bubble up appropriately, don't swallow them
7. **Type Safety**: Properly type async functions and their return values
8. **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup in async operations (e.g., file handles, connections) using try/finally
9. **Background Jobs**: Use async job processors (BullMQ) with proper async/await patterns
10. **HTTP Requests**: Convert synchronous HTTP calls to async/await with proper timeout handling

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 1. Architecture Review
- Focus on identifying issues and improvements
- Document findings and decisions
- Compare implemented async/await patterns with Node.js/TypeScript best practices
- Review both existing code and planned structure to ensure consistent async/await usage
- Reference Rails async patterns from jarek-va but adapt to Node.js/TypeScript conventions
- **Important**: Even if the codebase is not fully implemented, this review should establish async/await patterns and guidelines for future implementation
- Review should validate that planned async/await patterns align with Rails sequential patterns (where applicable) and Node.js/TypeScript best practices
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Key Rails files to reference:
  - `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` - Sequential operations (download → transcribe → send) that should use async/await
  - `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` - Synchronous HTTP calls that should be async
  - `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb` - Synchronous HTTP calls with timeout handling that should use async/await
- Conversion patterns:
  - Rails `ensure` blocks → Node.js `try/finally` with async cleanup
  - Rails synchronous HTTP → Node.js async HTTP with async/await
  - Rails Sidekiq jobs → Node.js BullMQ jobs with async processors
  - Rails sequential operations → Node.js async/await (or Promise.all() for parallel)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
