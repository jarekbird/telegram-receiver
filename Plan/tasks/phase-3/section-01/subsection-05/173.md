# PHASE3-005: Review async/await patterns and Promise handling

**Section**: 1. Architecture Review
**Subsection**: 1.5
**Task ID**: PHASE3-005

## Description

Review and improve async/await patterns and Promise handling in the codebase to ensure best practices. This review should evaluate how asynchronous operations are handled across all layers (controllers, services, jobs, middleware), verify consistent async/await usage, check for proper Promise handling, identify opportunities for parallelization, and ensure proper error handling in async contexts.

## Architecture Reference

Reference the planned architecture from:

- `Plan/app-description.md` - Application overview and component descriptions
- `Plan/CONVERSION_STEPS.md` - Conversion plan and architecture considerations
- `src/` directory structure - Current implementation structure

The application follows a layered architecture with:

- **Controllers** (`src/controllers/`) - HTTP request handling and routing
- **Services** (`src/services/`) - Business logic and external API integration
- **Models** (`src/models/`) - Data models and database interactions
- **Routes** (`src/routes/`) - Route definitions and middleware
- **Middleware** (`src/middleware/`) - Request processing middleware
- **Jobs** - Background job processing (BullMQ)
- **Utils** (`src/utils/`) - Utility functions and helpers
- **Types** (`src/types/`) - TypeScript type definitions

## Rails Async Patterns (Reference)

The jarek-va Rails application uses synchronous operations that need to be converted to async/await in Node.js/TypeScript:

### Background Jobs (Sidekiq → BullMQ)

- **TelegramMessageJob** (`jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb`): Processes updates asynchronously via Sidekiq
  - Rails: `TelegramMessageJob.perform_later(update)` - enqueues job
  - Node.js: Should use BullMQ job queue with async processors
  - Job methods should be async functions
  - Sequential operations (download → transcribe → send) should use async/await

### Service Operations

- **TelegramService** (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`): Synchronous HTTP calls
  - Rails: Uses `bot.api.send_message()` synchronously
  - Node.js: Should use async/await for HTTP requests
  - File downloads (`download_file`) should be async with proper cleanup
  - Multiple API calls should be parallelized where possible

- **CursorRunnerService** (`jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb`): Synchronous HTTP calls
  - Rails: Uses `Net::HTTP` synchronously with timeouts
  - Node.js: Should use async HTTP client (axios/fetch) with async/await
  - Timeout handling should use Promise.race() or AbortController
  - Error handling should propagate async errors properly

### Sequential Operations

- **TelegramMessageJob.transcribe_audio**: Sequential operations (download → transcribe → cleanup)
  - Rails: Uses `ensure` blocks for cleanup
  - Node.js: Should use `try/finally` with async cleanup
  - File operations should be async (fs.promises)

- **TelegramMessageJob.send_text_as_audio**: Sequential operations (synthesize → send → cleanup)
  - Rails: Uses `ensure` blocks for cleanup
  - Node.js: Should use `try/finally` with async cleanup
  - Error handling should handle cleanup errors gracefully

### Resource Cleanup

- Rails uses `ensure` blocks for cleanup (file deletion, connection closing)
- Node.js should use `try/finally` with async cleanup operations
- Cleanup errors should be logged but not fail the operation

## Async/Await Best Practices

In Node.js/TypeScript applications, async/await patterns should follow these best practices:

1. **Prefer async/await over Promise chains**: Use async/await for better readability and error handling
2. **Consistent Error Handling**: Always use try/catch with async/await or .catch() with Promises
3. **Avoid Promise Anti-patterns**: Don't mix async/await with Promise chains unnecessarily
4. **Parallel Execution**: Use Promise.all() for independent parallel operations
5. **Sequential Execution**: Use await in loops only when operations depend on each other
6. **Error Propagation**: Let errors bubble up appropriately, don't swallow them
7. **Type Safety**: Properly type async functions and their return values
8. **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup in async operations (e.g., file handles, connections) using try/finally
9. **Background Jobs**: Use async job processors (BullMQ) with proper async/await patterns
10. **HTTP Requests**: Convert synchronous HTTP calls to async/await with proper timeout handling

- Section: 1. Architecture Review
- Focus on identifying issues and improvements
- Document findings and decisions
- Compare implemented async/await patterns with Node.js/TypeScript best practices
- Review both existing code and planned structure to ensure consistent async/await usage
- Reference Rails async patterns from jarek-va but adapt to Node.js/TypeScript conventions
- **Important**: Even if the codebase is not fully implemented, this review should establish async/await patterns and guidelines for future implementation
- Review should validate that planned async/await patterns align with Rails sequential patterns (where applicable) and Node.js/TypeScript best practices
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Key Rails files to reference:
  - `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` - Sequential operations (download → transcribe → send) that should use async/await
  - `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` - Synchronous HTTP calls that should be async
  - `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb` - Synchronous HTTP calls with timeout handling that should use async/await
- Conversion patterns:
  - Rails `ensure` blocks → Node.js `try/finally` with async cleanup
  - Rails synchronous HTTP → Node.js async HTTP with async/await
  - Rails Sidekiq jobs → Node.js BullMQ jobs with async processors
  - Rails sequential operations → Node.js async/await (or Promise.all() for parallel)

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
