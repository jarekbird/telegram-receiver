# PHASE3-004: Review error handling strategies

**Section**: 1. Architecture Review
**Subsection**: 1.4
**Task ID**: PHASE3-004

## Description

Review and improve error handling strategies in the codebase to ensure best practices. This review should evaluate how errors are handled across all layers (controllers, services, jobs, middleware), verify consistent error handling patterns, check error propagation and logging, identify inconsistencies, and ensure proper error responses are returned to clients.

## Architecture Reference

Reference the planned architecture from:

- `Plan/app-description.md` - Application overview and component descriptions
- `Plan/CONVERSION_STEPS.md` - Conversion plan and architecture considerations
- `src/` directory structure - Current implementation structure

The application follows a layered architecture with:

- **Controllers** (`src/controllers/`) - HTTP request handling and routing
- **Services** (`src/services/`) - Business logic and external API integration
- **Models** (`src/models/`) - Data models and database interactions
- **Routes** (`src/routes/`) - Route definitions and middleware
- **Middleware** (`src/middleware/`) - Request processing middleware
- **Jobs** - Background job processing (BullMQ)
- **Utils** (`src/utils/`) - Utility functions and helpers
- **Types** (`src/types/`) - TypeScript type definitions

## Error Handling Best Practices

In Node.js/TypeScript applications, error handling should follow these patterns:

1. **Custom Error Classes**: Use custom error classes that extend `Error` for different error types
2. **Error Propagation**: Let errors bubble up appropriately, don't swallow errors silently
3. **Error Middleware**: Use Express error middleware to handle errors consistently
4. **Structured Error Responses**: Return consistent error response formats
5. **Error Logging**: Log errors with appropriate context and severity levels
6. **Async Error Handling**: Properly handle errors in async/await and Promise chains
7. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript to type errors appropriately

## Rails Error Handling Patterns (Reference)

The jarek-va Rails application uses the following error handling patterns that should be adapted for Node.js/TypeScript:

### Application-Level Error Handling

- **ApplicationController** (`jarek-va/app/controllers/application_controller.rb`): Uses `rescue_from StandardError` to catch all unhandled errors
  - Logs error with class, message, and full backtrace
  - Returns consistent error response: `{ ok: false, say: 'Sorry, I encountered an error...', result: { error: message } }`
  - Uses HTTP 500 status code

### Controller Error Handling

- **TelegramController** (`jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb`): Uses rescue blocks for specific error handling
  - Webhook endpoint always returns 200 OK to Telegram (even on error) to prevent retries
  - Tries to send error message to user via Telegram if chat info is available
  - Admin endpoints return error JSON with appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Error responses: `{ ok: false, error: message }` for admin endpoints

### Service Error Handling

- **TelegramService** (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`): Services raise errors and let them propagate
  - Logs errors with context before re-raising
  - Does not catch and ignore errors
  - Uses rescue blocks only for logging, then re-raises

- **CursorRunnerService** (`jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb`): Uses custom error classes
  - Custom error classes: `Error`, `ConnectionError`, `TimeoutError`, `InvalidResponseError`
  - Handles specific error types (connection failures, timeouts, invalid responses)
  - Raises appropriate error types for different failure scenarios
  - Handles HTTP 422 as valid response (operation failed but request was valid)

### Job Error Handling

- **TelegramMessageJob** (`jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb`): Comprehensive error handling
  - Catches errors in perform method
  - Logs errors with full backtrace
  - Tries to send error message to Telegram user before re-raising
  - Re-raises error to mark job as failed (for retry logic)
  - Handles nested errors (e.g., error sending error message)
  - Truncates error messages for Telegram's 4096 character limit
  - Uses ensure blocks for cleanup (file deletion)

### Error Response Formats

- Standard error format: `{ ok: false, error: message }` or `{ ok: false, say: message, result: { error: ... } }`
- HTTP status codes: 500 for internal errors, 401 for unauthorized, 422 for validation errors
- Error messages are user-friendly but don't expose sensitive implementation details

### Error Logging

- Uses Rails.logger.error for all errors
- Includes error class, message, and full backtrace
- Logs context information (request ID, chat ID, etc.)
- Does not log sensitive information (tokens, passwords)

### Resource Cleanup

- Uses ensure blocks for cleanup operations (file deletion, connection closing)
- Handles cleanup errors gracefully (logs warning, doesn't fail on cleanup errors)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
