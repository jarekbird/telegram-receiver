# PHASE3-004: Review error handling strategies

**Section**: 1. Architecture Review
**Subsection**: 1.4
**Task ID**: PHASE3-004

## Description

Review and improve error handling strategies in the codebase to ensure best practices. This review should evaluate how errors are handled across all layers (controllers, services, jobs, middleware), verify consistent error handling patterns, check error propagation and logging, identify inconsistencies, and ensure proper error responses are returned to clients.

## Architecture Reference

Reference the planned architecture from:

- `Plan/app-description.md` - Application overview and component descriptions
- `Plan/CONVERSION_STEPS.md` - Conversion plan and architecture considerations
- `src/` directory structure - Current implementation structure

The application follows a layered architecture with:

- **Controllers** (`src/controllers/`) - HTTP request handling and routing
- **Services** (`src/services/`) - Business logic and external API integration
- **Models** (`src/models/`) - Data models and database interactions
- **Routes** (`src/routes/`) - Route definitions and middleware
- **Middleware** (`src/middleware/`) - Request processing middleware
- **Jobs** - Background job processing (BullMQ)
- **Utils** (`src/utils/`) - Utility functions and helpers
- **Types** (`src/types/`) - TypeScript type definitions

## Error Handling Best Practices

In Node.js/TypeScript applications, error handling should follow these patterns:

1. **Custom Error Classes**: Use custom error classes that extend `Error` for different error types
2. **Error Propagation**: Let errors bubble up appropriately, don't swallow errors silently
3. **Error Middleware**: Use Express error middleware to handle errors consistently
4. **Structured Error Responses**: Return consistent error response formats
5. **Error Logging**: Log errors with appropriate context and severity levels
6. **Async Error Handling**: Properly handle errors in async/await and Promise chains
7. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript to type errors appropriately

## Rails Error Handling Patterns (Reference)

The jarek-va Rails application uses the following error handling patterns that should be adapted for Node.js/TypeScript:

### Application-Level Error Handling

- **ApplicationController** (`jarek-va/app/controllers/application_controller.rb`): Uses `rescue_from StandardError` to catch all unhandled errors
  - Logs error with class, message, and full backtrace
  - Returns consistent error response: `{ ok: false, say: 'Sorry, I encountered an error...', result: { error: message } }`
  - Uses HTTP 500 status code

### Controller Error Handling

- **TelegramController** (`jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb`): Uses rescue blocks for specific error handling
  - Webhook endpoint always returns 200 OK to Telegram (even on error) to prevent retries
  - Tries to send error message to user via Telegram if chat info is available
  - Admin endpoints return error JSON with appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Error responses: `{ ok: false, error: message }` for admin endpoints

### Service Error Handling

- **TelegramService** (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`): Services raise errors and let them propagate
  - Logs errors with context before re-raising
  - Does not catch and ignore errors
  - Uses rescue blocks only for logging, then re-raises

- **CursorRunnerService** (`jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb`): Uses custom error classes
  - Custom error classes: `Error`, `ConnectionError`, `TimeoutError`, `InvalidResponseError`
  - Handles specific error types (connection failures, timeouts, invalid responses)
  - Raises appropriate error types for different failure scenarios
  - Handles HTTP 422 as valid response (operation failed but request was valid)

### Job Error Handling

- **TelegramMessageJob** (`jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb`): Comprehensive error handling
  - Catches errors in perform method
  - Logs errors with full backtrace
  - Tries to send error message to Telegram user before re-raising
  - Re-raises error to mark job as failed (for retry logic)
  - Handles nested errors (e.g., error sending error message)
  - Truncates error messages for Telegram's 4096 character limit
  - Uses ensure blocks for cleanup (file deletion)

### Error Response Formats

- Standard error format: `{ ok: false, error: message }` or `{ ok: false, say: message, result: { error: ... } }`
- HTTP status codes: 500 for internal errors, 401 for unauthorized, 422 for validation errors
- Error messages are user-friendly but don't expose sensitive implementation details

### Error Logging

- Uses Rails.logger.error for all errors
- Includes error class, message, and full backtrace
- Logs context information (request ID, chat ID, etc.)
- Does not log sensitive information (tokens, passwords)

### Resource Cleanup

- Uses ensure blocks for cleanup operations (file deletion, connection closing)
- Handles cleanup errors gracefully (logs warning, doesn't fail on cleanup errors)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
