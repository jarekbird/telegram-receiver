# PHASE3-002: Review separation of concerns

**Section**: 1. Architecture Review
**Subsection**: 1.2
**Task ID**: PHASE3-002

## Description

Review and improve separation of concerns in the codebase to ensure best practices. This review should evaluate how well the codebase adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, verify that each layer (controllers, services, jobs, models) has clearly defined responsibilities, and identify any violations where components are handling multiple concerns that should be separated.

**Current State Note**: The codebase currently has comprehensive architecture documentation (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/API_CONVENTIONS.md`) but minimal actual implementation code. The directory structure exists but most directories are empty. This review should focus on:

1. Validating that documented separation of concerns aligns with best practices
2. Ensuring the documented layer responsibilities are appropriate and clear
3. Identifying any gaps or inconsistencies in separation of concerns documentation
4. Verifying that the planned structure will support proper separation of concerns
5. Documenting findings and recommendations for when implementation begins
6. When implementation code exists, reviewing actual code against documented patterns

## Architecture Reference

Reference the planned architecture from:

- `Plan/app-description.md` - Application overview and component descriptions
- `Plan/CONVERSION_STEPS.md` - Conversion plan and architecture considerations
- `src/` directory structure - Current implementation structure

The application follows a layered architecture with:

- **Controllers** (`src/controllers/`) - HTTP request handling and routing
- **Services** (`src/services/`) - Business logic and external API integration
- **Models** (`src/models/`) - Data models and database interactions
- **Routes** (`src/routes/`) - Route definitions and middleware
- **Middleware** (`src/middleware/`) - Request processing middleware
- **Jobs** - Background job processing (BullMQ)
- **Utils** (`src/utils/`) - Utility functions and helpers
- **Types** (`src/types/`) - TypeScript type definitions

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 1. Architecture Review
- **Current State**: The codebase has comprehensive architecture documentation but minimal implementation code. Focus should be on validating documentation against separation of concerns best practices and identifying any gaps or inconsistencies.
- Focus on identifying issues and improvements in documentation and planned architecture
- Document findings and decisions
- Compare documented architecture with planned architecture from `Plan/app-description.md`
- Review both existing documentation and planned structure to ensure proper separation
- When implementation code exists, review actual code against documented patterns
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Current Implementation Status

**Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive

- `docs/architecture.md` - Detailed architecture documentation with layer responsibilities
- `docs/API.md` - API endpoint documentation
- `docs/API_CONVENTIONS.md` - API conventions and patterns with separation guidance

**Implementation**: ⚠️ Minimal

- Directory structure exists but directories are empty
- `src/index.ts` is empty
- No controllers, services, models, or routes implemented yet
- Configuration files exist (package.json, tsconfig.json)
- Test structure exists but minimal test files

**Recommendation**: Focus this review on validating documentation and ensuring the planned separation of concerns is sound before implementation begins. When code is implemented, revisit this task to review actual implementation against documented patterns.

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
