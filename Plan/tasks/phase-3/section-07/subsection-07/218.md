# PHASE3-050: Improve test quality

**Section**: 7. Testing Review
**Subsection**: 7.7
**Task ID**: PHASE3-050

## Description

Review and improve test quality in the codebase to ensure best practices. This includes reviewing and enhancing the test infrastructure (mocks, fixtures, helpers, utilities), establishing test quality standards, and creating guidelines for future test development.

## Current State

- Test infrastructure exists: mocks, fixtures, helpers, and utilities
- Test directory structure is established (unit, integration, e2e)
- No actual test files exist yet (`.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` files)
- Jest configuration is set up
- Test utilities and helpers are in place

## Checklist

### Test Infrastructure Review

- [ ] Review and improve test utilities (`tests/helpers/testUtils.ts`)
  - Ensure all utility functions are well-documented with JSDoc comments
  - Add type safety improvements where needed (currently has basic types)
  - Verify error handling in utility functions (expectRejection has error handling)
  - Add missing utility functions if needed:
    - Database helpers (if mentioned in README but not present)
    - Mock creation helpers (if mentioned in README but not present)
    - Date/time utilities for testing (createDate, createTimestamp)
    - ID generation utilities (createId, createUuid)
- [ ] Review and improve API helpers (`tests/helpers/apiHelpers.ts`)
  - Ensure HTTP status codes are complete (currently missing: 202 Accepted, 422 Unprocessable Entity, 429 Too Many Requests, 502 Bad Gateway, 503 Service Unavailable, 504 Gateway Timeout)
  - Verify helper functions are reusable
  - Add missing helper functions for common test scenarios (e.g., createTestHeaders, createWebhookHeaders)
  - Add helper functions for common request patterns (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- [ ] Review and improve mock implementations
  - Review `tests/mocks/telegramApi.ts` - ensure all Telegram API methods are mocked
    - Verify methods match actual Telegram Bot API: sendMessage, getUpdates, setWebhook, deleteWebhook, getWebhookInfo, getMe, downloadFile, sendVoice, sendPhoto, editMessageText, answerCallbackQuery
    - Ensure mock return types match Telegram API response structures
  - Review `tests/mocks/cursorRunnerApi.ts` - verify cursor-runner API coverage
    - Verify methods match actual cursor-runner API: sendMessage, iterate, iterateAsync, execute
    - Ensure mock return types match cursor-runner API response structures
  - Review `tests/mocks/redis.ts` - ensure Redis operations are properly mocked
    - Verify all Redis methods used in the application are mocked (get, set, del, exists, expire, keys, hget, hset, hdel, hgetall, ping, quit)
    - Add missing Redis operations if needed (e.g., mget, mset, incr, decr, ttl, pttl)
  - Add reset/cleanup functions if missing (verify resetTelegramApiMocks, resetCursorRunnerApiMocks, resetRedisMocks exist)
  - Ensure mocks return realistic data structures matching actual API responses
- [ ] Review and improve test fixtures
  - Review `tests/fixtures/telegramMessages.ts` - ensure fixtures cover all message types
    - Verify fixtures exist for: text messages, callback queries, webhook updates (currently present)
    - Add missing fixtures: voice messages, edited messages, channel messages, group messages, photo messages, document messages, location messages, contact messages
    - Add fixtures for edge cases: empty messages, messages with special characters, messages with entities (mentions, hashtags, URLs)
  - Review `tests/fixtures/apiResponses.ts` - verify response fixtures are complete
    - Ensure success and error response fixtures exist (currently present)
    - Add fixtures for: partial success responses, timeout responses, rate limit responses, validation error responses
    - Add fixtures for cursor-runner specific responses: task queued, task in progress, task completed, task failed
  - Add missing fixture types (error responses, edge cases)
  - Ensure fixtures are well-documented with JSDoc comments and usage examples

### Test Quality Standards

- [ ] Review test setup (`tests/setup.ts`)
  - Ensure environment variables are properly configured (NODE_ENV=test is set)
  - Verify timeout settings are appropriate (currently 10000ms - verify if this is sufficient for all test types)
  - Add global test utilities if needed (beforeAll, afterAll hooks for global setup/teardown)
  - Add global mock setup if needed (e.g., console.error suppression, global error handlers)
  - Consider adding test database setup/teardown if database tests will be added
- [ ] Review Jest configuration (`jest.config.ts`)
  - Verify coverage settings are appropriate
  - Ensure test patterns match project structure
  - Review module name mappings
- [ ] Establish test quality guidelines
  - Create a new document `tests/TEST_QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md` with comprehensive guidelines
  - Document test naming conventions (already partially in README.md)
  - Create guidelines for test structure (AAA pattern - Arrange, Act, Assert)
  - Document mock usage best practices (when to mock, how to reset mocks, mock data patterns)
  - Create guidelines for fixture usage (when to use fixtures vs inline data, fixture organization)
  - Document test coverage expectations (minimum 80% coverage, 100% for critical paths)
  - Add guidelines for test isolation and independence
  - Document async test patterns and best practices
  - Add guidelines for testing error scenarios and edge cases

### Code Quality Improvements

- [ ] Improve code documentation
  - Add JSDoc comments to all test utilities
  - Document mock functions and their usage
  - Add examples in fixture files
- [ ] Improve type safety
  - Add proper TypeScript types to all test utilities
  - Ensure mocks have correct return types
  - Add type guards where needed
- [ ] Refactor for maintainability
  - Remove any duplicate code in test utilities
  - Consolidate similar helper functions
  - Improve code organization

### Documentation

- [ ] Update test README (`tests/README.md`)
  - Ensure all test utilities are documented (currently has basic structure)
  - Add examples of using mocks and fixtures (add code examples)
  - Document test quality standards (reference TEST_QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md)
  - Add links to helper READMEs (helpers/README.md, mocks/README.md, fixtures/README.md)
  - Update examples to match actual implementation
- [ ] Create test quality guidelines document (`tests/TEST_QUALITY_GUIDELINES.md`)
  - Comprehensive guide for writing tests
  - Include all guidelines mentioned in "Test Quality Standards" section
  - Add examples and best practices
- [ ] Document test improvements made
  - Create a summary of improvements in the task notes or a separate document
  - Document any new utilities or helpers added
  - Note any breaking changes or deprecations
  - Update CHANGELOG if one exists

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 7. Testing Review
- Focus on improving test infrastructure and establishing quality standards
- Since no actual test files exist yet, focus on improving the foundation for future tests
- Document all findings and improvements
- Ensure all improvements follow TypeScript and Jest best practices

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Related Tasks

- Previous: PHASE3-049
- Next: PHASE4-001

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
