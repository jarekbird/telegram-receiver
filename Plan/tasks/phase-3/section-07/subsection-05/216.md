# PHASE3-048: Review test performance

**Section**: 7. Testing Review
**Subsection**: 7.5
**Task ID**: PHASE3-048

## Description

Review and improve test performance in the codebase to ensure best practices. This includes measuring test execution times, identifying slow tests, optimizing test setup/teardown, reviewing parallel execution configuration, and documenting performance benchmarks.

## Checklist

### Performance Measurement

- [ ] Measure overall test suite execution time
  - Run `npm test` and record total execution time
  - Run `npm run test:unit` and record unit test execution time
  - Run `npm run test:integration` and record integration test execution time
  - Run `npm run test:e2e` and record E2E test execution time
  - Note: If no tests exist, document that infrastructure is ready but no tests to measure yet
- [ ] Measure individual test execution times using Jest's `--verbose` flag
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Identify tests that exceed performance thresholds:
  - Unit tests should complete in < 100ms each
  - Integration tests should complete in < 1s each
  - E2E tests should complete in < 10s each (may vary based on complexity)
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Document baseline performance metrics for future comparison
  - If no tests exist: Document current configuration settings and establish performance targets/thresholds for when tests are added

### Test Configuration Review

- [ ] Review `jest.config.ts` for performance-related settings
  - Check `testTimeout` setting (currently 10000ms) - verify if appropriate
  - Review `maxWorkers` configuration for parallel execution
    - Note: `maxWorkers` is not explicitly set in config, so Jest uses default (50% of available CPU cores)
    - Consider explicitly setting `maxWorkers` for CI environments (e.g., `maxWorkers: process.env.CI ? 2 : '50%'`)
  - Check if `cache` is enabled
    - Note: `cache` is not explicitly set in config, so Jest uses default (true)
    - Verify cache directory is properly configured and not causing issues
  - Verify `passWithNoTests` setting (currently true) - consider if this should be false when tests exist
- [ ] Review `playwright.config.ts` for E2E test performance settings
  - Check `fullyParallel` setting (currently true) - verify worker configuration
  - Review `workers` setting for CI vs local environments
  - Check `retries` configuration and impact on total execution time
  - Review `webServer` configuration and startup time impact
- [ ] Review `tests/setup.ts` for global timeout settings
  - Current `jest.setTimeout(10000)` - verify if appropriate for all test types
  - Consider different timeouts for unit vs integration tests

### Test Setup and Teardown Optimization

- [ ] Review test setup procedures in `tests/setup.ts`
  - Check for unnecessary global setup operations
  - Verify environment variable setup is efficient
  - Current setup: Sets `NODE_ENV=test` and `jest.setTimeout(10000)` - verify if appropriate
- [ ] Review `beforeAll`/`afterAll` hooks in test files
  - Identify expensive setup operations that could be optimized
  - Check for redundant setup/teardown across test files
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Review `beforeEach`/`afterEach` hooks
  - Identify operations that could be moved to `beforeAll`/`afterAll`
  - Check for unnecessary cleanup operations
  - Verify test isolation without excessive setup overhead
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist

### Slow Test Identification and Optimization

- [ ] Identify slow unit tests (`tests/unit/`)
  - Review tests that exceed 100ms threshold
  - Check for unnecessary async operations or delays
  - Verify proper mocking of external dependencies
  - Review test data setup efficiency
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Identify slow integration tests (`tests/integration/`)
  - Review tests that exceed 1s threshold
  - Check for unnecessary waits or delays
  - Verify efficient use of test databases/Redis instances
  - Review API mocking efficiency (nock, sinon)
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Identify slow E2E tests (`tests/e2e/`)
  - Review tests that exceed 10s threshold
  - Check for unnecessary page waits or timeouts
  - Verify efficient use of Playwright fixtures
  - Review test data setup and cleanup efficiency
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist

### Parallel Execution Review

- [ ] Review Jest parallel execution configuration
  - Verify `maxWorkers` is set appropriately for CI/local environments
    - Currently not explicitly set - uses Jest default (50% of CPU cores)
    - Consider adding explicit configuration for better control
  - Check for test dependencies that prevent parallel execution
  - Review shared resource usage (databases, Redis) in parallel tests
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Review Playwright parallel execution
  - Verify `fullyParallel: true` is appropriate for all tests
  - Check `workers` setting: Currently `process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined` (uses default on local)
  - Check for tests that require sequential execution
  - Review worker configuration for optimal performance
- [ ] Test parallel execution stability
  - Run tests multiple times to check for flakiness
  - Verify no race conditions in parallel test execution
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist

### Unnecessary Waits and Delays

- [ ] Search for hardcoded delays (`setTimeout`, `sleep`, `wait`)
  - Review `tests/helpers/testUtils.ts` for delay utilities
    - Found: `waitFor(ms: number)` function that creates delays using `setTimeout`
    - Check if this utility is necessary or can be replaced with proper async handling
    - Verify delays are not masking timing issues
  - Search test files for direct use of `setTimeout`, `sleep`, or `wait` functions
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Review test timeouts
  - Check for overly generous timeout values
  - Verify timeouts are appropriate for actual operation times
  - Consider reducing timeouts where possible
  - Current global timeout: 10000ms in `tests/setup.ts` - verify if appropriate for all test types

### Test Infrastructure Optimization

- [ ] Review test helper utilities (`tests/helpers/`)
  - Check for inefficient helper functions
  - Verify helper functions don't introduce unnecessary overhead
- [ ] Review test fixtures (`tests/fixtures/`)
  - Check for large fixture data that could be optimized
  - Verify fixture loading efficiency
- [ ] Review test mocks (`tests/mocks/`)
  - Verify mocks are efficient and don't introduce delays
  - Check for unnecessary mock complexity

### Performance Optimization Actions

- [ ] Optimize identified slow tests
  - Refactor slow unit tests to improve execution time
  - Optimize integration test setup/teardown
  - Improve E2E test efficiency
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Update test configuration for optimal performance
  - Adjust Jest worker configuration if needed (consider adding explicit `maxWorkers`)
  - Update Playwright worker settings if needed
  - Optimize timeout settings (consider different timeouts for unit vs integration tests)
- [ ] Implement performance best practices
  - Use appropriate test isolation strategies
  - Optimize shared test resources
  - Implement efficient test data management
  - Document performance guidelines for future test development

### Documentation

- [ ] Document test performance benchmarks
  - Record baseline execution times for each test type
  - Document performance targets and thresholds
  - Create performance tracking documentation
- [ ] Update `tests/README.md` with performance guidelines
  - Document performance best practices
  - Add guidance on test optimization
  - Include performance thresholds and expectations
- [ ] Document findings and optimization recommendations
  - List identified performance issues
  - Document optimization actions taken
  - Note any trade-offs made for performance

## Notes

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
