# PHASE3-048: Review test performance

**Section**: 7. Testing Review
**Subsection**: 7.5
**Task ID**: PHASE3-048

## Description

Review and improve test performance in the codebase to ensure best practices. This includes measuring test execution times, identifying slow tests, optimizing test setup/teardown, reviewing parallel execution configuration, and documenting performance benchmarks.

## Checklist

### Performance Measurement

- [ ] Measure overall test suite execution time
  - Run `npm test` and record total execution time
  - Run `npm run test:unit` and record unit test execution time
  - Run `npm run test:integration` and record integration test execution time
  - Run `npm run test:e2e` and record E2E test execution time
  - Note: If no tests exist, document that infrastructure is ready but no tests to measure yet
- [ ] Measure individual test execution times using Jest's `--verbose` flag
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Identify tests that exceed performance thresholds:
  - Unit tests should complete in < 100ms each
  - Integration tests should complete in < 1s each
  - E2E tests should complete in < 10s each (may vary based on complexity)
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Document baseline performance metrics for future comparison
  - If no tests exist: Document current configuration settings and establish performance targets/thresholds for when tests are added

### Test Configuration Review

- [ ] Review `jest.config.ts` for performance-related settings
  - Check `testTimeout` setting (currently 10000ms) - verify if appropriate
  - Review `maxWorkers` configuration for parallel execution
    - Note: `maxWorkers` is not explicitly set in config, so Jest uses default (50% of available CPU cores)
    - Consider explicitly setting `maxWorkers` for CI environments (e.g., `maxWorkers: process.env.CI ? 2 : '50%'`)
  - Check if `cache` is enabled
    - Note: `cache` is not explicitly set in config, so Jest uses default (true)
    - Verify cache directory is properly configured and not causing issues
  - Verify `passWithNoTests` setting (currently true) - consider if this should be false when tests exist
- [ ] Review `playwright.config.ts` for E2E test performance settings
  - Check `fullyParallel` setting (currently true) - verify worker configuration
  - Review `workers` setting for CI vs local environments
  - Check `retries` configuration and impact on total execution time
  - Review `webServer` configuration and startup time impact
- [ ] Review `tests/setup.ts` for global timeout settings
  - Current `jest.setTimeout(10000)` - verify if appropriate for all test types
  - Consider different timeouts for unit vs integration tests

### Test Setup and Teardown Optimization

- [ ] Review test setup procedures in `tests/setup.ts`
  - Check for unnecessary global setup operations
  - Verify environment variable setup is efficient
  - Current setup: Sets `NODE_ENV=test` and `jest.setTimeout(10000)` - verify if appropriate
- [ ] Review `beforeAll`/`afterAll` hooks in test files
  - Identify expensive setup operations that could be optimized
  - Check for redundant setup/teardown across test files
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Review `beforeEach`/`afterEach` hooks
  - Identify operations that could be moved to `beforeAll`/`afterAll`
  - Check for unnecessary cleanup operations
  - Verify test isolation without excessive setup overhead
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist

### Slow Test Identification and Optimization

- [ ] Identify slow unit tests (`tests/unit/`)
  - Review tests that exceed 100ms threshold
  - Check for unnecessary async operations or delays
  - Verify proper mocking of external dependencies
  - Review test data setup efficiency
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Identify slow integration tests (`tests/integration/`)
  - Review tests that exceed 1s threshold
  - Check for unnecessary waits or delays
  - Verify efficient use of test databases/Redis instances
  - Review API mocking efficiency (nock, sinon)
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Identify slow E2E tests (`tests/e2e/`)
  - Review tests that exceed 10s threshold
  - Check for unnecessary page waits or timeouts
  - Verify efficient use of Playwright fixtures
  - Review test data setup and cleanup efficiency
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist

### Parallel Execution Review

- [ ] Review Jest parallel execution configuration
  - Verify `maxWorkers` is set appropriately for CI/local environments
    - Currently not explicitly set - uses Jest default (50% of CPU cores)
    - Consider adding explicit configuration for better control
  - Check for test dependencies that prevent parallel execution
  - Review shared resource usage (databases, Redis) in parallel tests
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Review Playwright parallel execution
  - Verify `fullyParallel: true` is appropriate for all tests
  - Check `workers` setting: Currently `process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined` (uses default on local)
  - Check for tests that require sequential execution
  - Review worker configuration for optimal performance
- [ ] Test parallel execution stability
  - Run tests multiple times to check for flakiness
  - Verify no race conditions in parallel test execution
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist

### Unnecessary Waits and Delays

- [ ] Search for hardcoded delays (`setTimeout`, `sleep`, `wait`)
  - Review `tests/helpers/testUtils.ts` for delay utilities
    - Found: `waitFor(ms: number)` function that creates delays using `setTimeout`
    - Check if this utility is necessary or can be replaced with proper async handling
    - Verify delays are not masking timing issues
  - Search test files for direct use of `setTimeout`, `sleep`, or `wait` functions
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Review test timeouts
  - Check for overly generous timeout values
  - Verify timeouts are appropriate for actual operation times
  - Consider reducing timeouts where possible
  - Current global timeout: 10000ms in `tests/setup.ts` - verify if appropriate for all test types

### Test Infrastructure Optimization

- [ ] Review test helper utilities (`tests/helpers/`)
  - Check for inefficient helper functions
  - Verify helper functions don't introduce unnecessary overhead
- [ ] Review test fixtures (`tests/fixtures/`)
  - Check for large fixture data that could be optimized
  - Verify fixture loading efficiency
- [ ] Review test mocks (`tests/mocks/`)
  - Verify mocks are efficient and don't introduce delays
  - Check for unnecessary mock complexity

### Performance Optimization Actions

- [ ] Optimize identified slow tests
  - Refactor slow unit tests to improve execution time
  - Optimize integration test setup/teardown
  - Improve E2E test efficiency
  - Note: Only applicable when test files exist
- [ ] Update test configuration for optimal performance
  - Adjust Jest worker configuration if needed (consider adding explicit `maxWorkers`)
  - Update Playwright worker settings if needed
  - Optimize timeout settings (consider different timeouts for unit vs integration tests)
- [ ] Implement performance best practices
  - Use appropriate test isolation strategies
  - Optimize shared test resources
  - Implement efficient test data management
  - Document performance guidelines for future test development

### Documentation

- [ ] Document test performance benchmarks
  - Record baseline execution times for each test type
  - Document performance targets and thresholds
  - Create performance tracking documentation
- [ ] Update `tests/README.md` with performance guidelines
  - Document performance best practices
  - Add guidance on test optimization
  - Include performance thresholds and expectations
- [ ] Document findings and optimization recommendations
  - List identified performance issues
  - Document optimization actions taken
  - Note any trade-offs made for performance

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 7. Testing Review
- Subsection: 7.5 - Test Performance Review
- Focus on identifying performance issues and optimizing test execution time
- Document findings and decisions for future reference
- Reference `jest.config.ts` and `playwright.config.ts` for test configuration
- Reference `tests/README.md` for test structure and guidelines
- Current test infrastructure:
  - Jest for unit and integration tests (configured in `jest.config.ts`)
  - Playwright for E2E tests (configured in `playwright.config.ts`)
  - Test setup in `tests/setup.ts` with 10s default timeout
  - Test helpers, fixtures, and mocks available in `tests/` directory
- Note: Currently no test files exist, but infrastructure is in place. This review should focus on:
  - Configuration optimization (Jest, Playwright, test setup)
  - Reviewing existing test utilities, mocks, and fixtures for performance considerations
  - Establishing performance guidelines and thresholds for when tests are added
  - Documenting performance best practices in `tests/README.md`
  - Checklist items marked "Only applicable when test files exist" should be skipped or documented as future considerations
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
