# PHASE3-044: Review test coverage

**Section**: 7. Testing Review
**Subsection**: 7.1
**Task ID**: PHASE3-044

## Description

Review and improve test coverage in the codebase to ensure best practices. This task involves analyzing the current test coverage, identifying gaps, setting appropriate coverage targets, and documenting the coverage status.

## Checklist

- [ ] Run test coverage report using `npm run test:coverage`
- [ ] Review coverage percentages for statements, branches, functions, and lines
- [ ] Review coverage configuration in `jest.config.ts` (collectCoverageFrom, coverageReporters, etc.)
- [ ] Review coverage exclusions (check if `collectCoverageFrom` patterns correctly exclude test files, type definitions, etc.)
- [ ] Identify uncovered code areas and files with low coverage
- [ ] Review critical path coverage (core business logic, API endpoints, services)
  - Controllers: Webhook handling, callback processing
  - Services: TelegramService, CursorRunnerService, CursorRunnerCallbackService, ElevenLabs services
  - Jobs: TelegramMessageJob
  - Middleware: Authentication, error handling
- [ ] Check for coverage gaps across different test types (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Review coverage for each source directory (controllers, services, models, middleware, utils, validators, errors)
- [ ] Set coverage thresholds in `jest.config.ts` (see Notes section for recommended values)
- [ ] Document coverage targets by area (controllers, services, etc.) with rationale
- [ ] Document coverage status and findings in this task file or a coverage report
- [ ] Identify priority areas that need additional test coverage
- [ ] Document any coverage exclusions and their rationale

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 7. Testing Review
- Focus on identifying issues and improvements
- Document findings and decisions

- **Test Coverage Command**: Use `npm run test:coverage` to generate coverage reports
- **Coverage Reports**: Generated in `coverage/` directory (HTML, LCOV, text formats)
- **Coverage Configuration**: Review `jest.config.ts` for coverage settings
- **Current State**: Codebase is in early development - coverage may be minimal initially
- **Coverage Metrics**: Focus on statements, branches, functions, and lines coverage
- **Priority Areas**: Controllers, services, and core business logic should have higher coverage targets

- **Coverage Thresholds** (Recommended - as per PHASE3-045 recommendation):
  - Consider setting minimum coverage thresholds in `jest.config.ts` using `coverageThreshold`:
    - Global thresholds: Start with 60-70% for early development, increase to 80%+ as codebase matures
    - Per-directory thresholds: Higher targets for critical paths (controllers: 80%+, services: 80%+, utils: 70%+)
    - Example configuration:
      ```typescript
      coverageThreshold: {
        global: {
          branches: 60,
          functions: 60,
          lines: 60,
          statements: 60
        },
        './src/controllers/': {
          branches: 80,
          functions: 80,
          lines: 80,
          statements: 80
        },
        './src/services/': {
          branches: 80,
          functions: 80,
          lines: 80,
          statements: 80
        }
      }
      ```
  - Thresholds should be set based on current coverage state and gradually increased
  - Consider starting with warnings instead of failures during early development

- **Coverage Exclusions**: Review `collectCoverageFrom` patterns to ensure:
  - Test files are excluded (`!src/**/*.test.ts`, `!src/**/*.spec.ts`)
  - Type definition files are excluded (`!src/**/*.d.ts`)
  - Configuration files may be excluded if appropriate
  - Index/barrel files may have lower coverage requirements

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
