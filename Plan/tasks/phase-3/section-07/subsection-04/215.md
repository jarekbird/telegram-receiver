# PHASE3-047: Review integration test coverage

**Section**: 7. Testing Review
**Subsection**: 7.4
**Task ID**: PHASE3-047

## Description

Review and improve integration test coverage in the codebase to ensure best practices. Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly, testing API endpoints and service interactions with proper test isolation.

**Note**: If integration tests do not exist yet, this task should create them based on the Rails implementation patterns. Reference the Rails controller specs in `jarek-va/spec/controllers/` as examples of comprehensive integration test coverage.

## Checklist

### Current State Review

- [ ] Review existing integration tests in `tests/integration/` directory (create if missing)
- [ ] Check integration test structure and organization
- [ ] Review test setup and teardown procedures
- [ ] Verify test isolation and cleanup mechanisms
- [ ] Compare with Rails controller specs in `jarek-va/spec/controllers/` to identify test scenarios

### API Endpoint Integration Tests (`tests/integration/api/`)

- [ ] Review/create Telegram webhook endpoint integration tests (`POST /telegram/webhook`)
  - Test webhook authentication with `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header (unauthorized without token, authorized with token)

    - Regular messages (`message`)
    - Edited messages (`edited_message`)
    - Callback queries (`callback_query`)
    - Unhandled update types
  - Test async processing and immediate 200 OK response (to prevent Telegram retries)
  - Test job enqueueing for message processing
  - Test error handling and invalid payloads
  - Test error scenarios (job enqueue failures, service errors)
  - Reference: `jarek-va/spec/controllers/telegram_controller_spec.rb` for comprehensive test scenarios
- [ ] Review/create admin endpoint integration tests (if implemented)

### Critical Path Coverage

- [ ] Verify end-to-end flow coverage: Telegram webhook → message processing → Cursor Runner → callback → Telegram response
- [ ] Test local command processing (`/start`, `/help`, `/status`) without Cursor Runner forwarding
- [ ] Test non-command message forwarding to Cursor Runner
- [ ] Test audio message transcription flow (if implemented)
- [ ] Test error scenarios and graceful degradation

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 7. Testing Review
- Subsection: 7.4 - Integration Test Coverage Review
- Focus on identifying issues and improvements in integration test coverage
- Document findings and decisions for future reference
- Reference `Plan/app-description.md` for application functionality that should be tested
- Reference `tests/README.md` and `tests/integration/README.md` for test structure and guidelines
- Reference Rails controller specs in `jarek-va/spec/controllers/` for comprehensive test scenario examples:
  - `telegram_controller_spec.rb` - Webhook endpoint tests, admin endpoint tests, authentication tests
  - `cursor_runner_callback_controller_spec.rb` - Callback processing tests, error handling, output formatting
- Integration tests should use Supertest for API endpoint testing
- External APIs (Telegram Bot API, Cursor Runner API) should be mocked using nock or similar
- Integration tests may use real Redis connections but should use test databases/instances
- If integration tests don't exist, create them following the patterns from Rails controller specs
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Related Tasks

- Previous: PHASE3-046
- Next: PHASE3-048

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
