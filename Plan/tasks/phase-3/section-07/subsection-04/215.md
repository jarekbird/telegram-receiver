# PHASE3-047: Review integration test coverage

**Section**: 7. Testing Review
**Subsection**: 7.4
**Task ID**: PHASE3-047

## Description

Review and improve integration test coverage in the codebase to ensure best practices. Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly, testing API endpoints and service interactions with proper test isolation.

**Note**: If integration tests do not exist yet, this task should create them based on the Rails implementation patterns. Reference the Rails controller specs in `jarek-va/spec/controllers/` as examples of comprehensive integration test coverage.

## Checklist

### Current State Review

- [ ] Review existing integration tests in `tests/integration/` directory (create if missing)
- [ ] Check integration test structure and organization
- [ ] Review test setup and teardown procedures
- [ ] Verify test isolation and cleanup mechanisms
- [ ] Compare with Rails controller specs in `jarek-va/spec/controllers/` to identify test scenarios

### API Endpoint Integration Tests (`tests/integration/api/`)

- [ ] Review/create Telegram webhook endpoint integration tests (`POST /telegram/webhook`)
  - Test webhook authentication with `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header (unauthorized without token, authorized with token)
  - Test processing of different update types:
    - Regular messages (`message`)
    - Edited messages (`edited_message`)
    - Callback queries (`callback_query`)
    - Unhandled update types
  - Test async processing and immediate 200 OK response (to prevent Telegram retries)
  - Test job enqueueing for message processing
  - Test error handling and invalid payloads
  - Test error scenarios (job enqueue failures, service errors)
  - Reference: `jarek-va/spec/controllers/telegram_controller_spec.rb` for comprehensive test scenarios
- [ ] Review/create admin endpoint integration tests (if implemented)
  - `POST /telegram/set_webhook` (admin only)
    - Test admin authentication (`X-Admin-Secret` header)
    - Test unauthorized access without admin secret
    - Test webhook URL setting with default and custom URLs
    - Test error handling for Telegram API failures
  - `GET /telegram/webhook_info` (admin only)
    - Test admin authentication
    - Test webhook info retrieval
    - Test error handling
  - `DELETE /telegram/webhook` (admin only)
    - Test admin authentication
    - Test webhook deletion
    - Test error handling
  - Reference: `jarek-va/spec/controllers/telegram_controller_spec.rb` for admin endpoint tests
- [ ] Review/create Cursor Runner callback endpoint integration tests (`POST /cursor-runner/callback`)
  - Test callback authentication (`X-Webhook-Secret` header or query parameter)
  - Test callback processing and response forwarding to Telegram
  - Test Redis state retrieval and cleanup
  - Test error handling for invalid callbacks (missing request_id, unknown request_id)
  - Test success and failure result handling
  - Test debug mode vs normal mode output formatting
  - Test ANSI escape sequence removal
  - Test long output truncation
  - Test Markdown/HTML parsing fallback logic
  - Test error scenarios (processing errors, parsing failures)
  - Reference: `jarek-va/spec/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller_spec.rb` for comprehensive test scenarios

### Service Integration Tests (`tests/integration/services/`)

- [ ] Review TelegramService + CursorRunnerService integration tests
  - Test message forwarding flow from Telegram to Cursor Runner
  - Test request ID generation and Redis storage
  - Test error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Review CursorRunnerCallbackService integration tests
  - Test callback state management in Redis
  - Test request context retrieval and cleanup
  - Test TTL handling for pending requests
- [ ] Review ElevenLabs services integration tests (if implemented)
  - Test audio transcription flow
  - Test text-to-speech conversion flow

### Critical Path Coverage

- [ ] Verify end-to-end flow coverage: Telegram webhook → message processing → Cursor Runner → callback → Telegram response
- [ ] Test local command processing (`/start`, `/help`, `/status`) without Cursor Runner forwarding
- [ ] Test non-command message forwarding to Cursor Runner
- [ ] Test audio message transcription flow (if implemented)
- [ ] Test error scenarios and graceful degradation
- [ ] Test that webhook always returns 200 OK even on errors (to prevent Telegram retries)

### Test Quality and Best Practices

- [ ] Review test scenarios for completeness
- [ ] Check for edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Review test data setup and fixtures usage
- [ ] Verify proper mocking of external APIs (Telegram Bot API, Cursor Runner API)
- [ ] Check test isolation (each test cleans up after itself)
- [ ] Review test timeout settings for async operations
- [ ] Verify test coverage metrics

### Missing Tests Identification

- [ ] Identify missing integration tests for implemented features
- [ ] Compare with Rails controller specs to identify missing test scenarios
- [ ] Document gaps in integration test coverage
- [ ] Prioritize missing tests by criticality
- [ ] Create missing integration tests if they don't exist

### Documentation

- [ ] Review and update `tests/integration/README.md` with current practices
- [ ] Document integration test strategy and patterns
- [ ] Document findings and improvement recommendations
- [ ] Update test coverage documentation

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 7. Testing Review
- Subsection: 7.4 - Integration Test Coverage Review
- Focus on identifying issues and improvements in integration test coverage
- Document findings and decisions for future reference
- Reference `Plan/app-description.md` for application functionality that should be tested
- Reference `tests/README.md` and `tests/integration/README.md` for test structure and guidelines
- Reference Rails controller specs in `jarek-va/spec/controllers/` for comprehensive test scenario examples:
  - `telegram_controller_spec.rb` - Webhook endpoint tests, admin endpoint tests, authentication tests
  - `cursor_runner_callback_controller_spec.rb` - Callback processing tests, error handling, output formatting
- Integration tests should use Supertest for API endpoint testing
- External APIs (Telegram Bot API, Cursor Runner API) should be mocked using nock or similar
- Integration tests may use real Redis connections but should use test databases/instances
- If integration tests don't exist, create them following the patterns from Rails controller specs
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Related Tasks

- Previous: PHASE3-046
- Next: PHASE3-048

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
