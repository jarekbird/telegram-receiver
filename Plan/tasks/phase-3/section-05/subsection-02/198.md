# PHASE3-030: Check for N+1 query problems

**Section**: 5. Performance Review
**Subsection**: 5.2
**Task ID**: PHASE3-030

## Description

Review and identify N+1 query problems in the codebase to ensure best practices. This task focuses on detecting patterns where multiple queries are executed in loops when they could be batched or optimized into a single query. The application uses MCP database connections (cursor-runner-shared-sqlite), Redis operations, and external API calls, all of which can exhibit N+1 patterns.

**Key Areas to Review:**

- **MCP Database Queries**: SystemSetting lookups and tasks table operations via cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection
- **Redis Operations**: Callback state management in `CursorRunnerCallbackService`, BullMQ job queue operations
- **External API Calls**: Telegram Bot API calls in `TelegramService`, Cursor Runner API calls in `CursorRunnerService`, ElevenLabs API calls
- **Background Job Processing**: BullMQ job processors that might query data for each job item
- **Message Processing**: `TelegramMessageJob` processing multiple updates or messages sequentially

Reference the Rails implementation patterns where applicable to understand expected query behavior:

- `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb` - Redis callback state management
- `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` - Telegram Bot API interactions
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` - Message processing patterns

## Checklist

### MCP Database Query Patterns

- [ ] Review MCP database query patterns (cursor-runner-shared-sqlite)
  - Identify loops that execute MCP queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - Check for patterns where a list query is followed by individual queries for each item
  - Look for SystemSetting queries executed in loops (e.g., checking multiple settings sequentially)
  - Look for tasks table queries executed in loops (e.g., updating multiple tasks one by one)
  - Review any service that accesses SystemSetting or tasks table for loop-based queries
  - Identify opportunities to batch multiple queries into single operations
- [ ] Check for N+1 patterns in MCP queries
  - Review code that fetches a list, then queries each item individually
  - Check if multiple SystemSetting lookups can be combined (e.g., fetching multiple settings in one query)
  - Verify if task queries can be batched (e.g., updating multiple tasks in a single transaction or batch UPDATE)
  - Look for patterns where related data is fetched separately instead of using JOINs or batch queries
  - Review task operator patterns that might query tasks individually instead of batching
  - Check if SystemSetting lookups in request handlers could be cached or batched

### Redis Query Patterns

- [ ] Review Redis operations for N+1 patterns
  - Check for loops that execute individual Redis GET/SET operations
  - Identify patterns where multiple Redis keys are accessed sequentially in loops
  - Review `CursorRunnerCallbackService` for patterns where multiple callbacks are processed individually
  - Check BullMQ job processing for patterns that access Redis keys in loops
  - Look for opportunities to use Redis pipelining for batch operations
  - Check if MGET/MSET could replace multiple individual GET/SET operations
  - Review callback cleanup operations that might delete keys one by one
- [ ] Check Redis batch operation opportunities
  - Verify if multiple Redis operations can be combined using pipelining
  - Check if hash operations (HGETALL, HMSET) could replace multiple string operations
  - Review if sorted sets or other structures could reduce query count
  - Check if callback state retrieval can be batched when processing multiple callbacks
  - Review BullMQ's internal Redis operations (ensure they're efficient, though this is library-managed)

### External API Call Patterns

- [ ] Review external API calls for N+1 patterns
  - Check `TelegramService` for Telegram Bot API calls executed in loops (sending messages to multiple users, getting file info for multiple files)
  - Review `CursorRunnerService` for Cursor Runner API calls that might be batched
  - Check `ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService` and `ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService` for batch opportunities
  - Review `TelegramMessageJob` for patterns that send multiple messages sequentially
  - Identify patterns where multiple API calls could be combined (e.g., sending multiple Telegram messages)
  - Check webhook management endpoints for sequential API calls
- [ ] Check for sequential API calls that could be parallelized
  - Review if Promise.all() could parallelize independent API calls (e.g., sending multiple Telegram messages concurrently)
  - Check if batch endpoints exist for external APIs (Telegram doesn't support batch, but parallelization is possible)
  - Verify if rate limiting considerations allow for batching or parallelization
  - Review callback processing that might make sequential API calls to Telegram
  - Check if file downloads from Telegram could be parallelized when processing multiple files

### Loop Analysis

- [ ] Identify loops with queries
  - Review all for/while/forEach loops that contain database queries (MCP, Redis, API calls)
  - Check map/filter/reduce operations that trigger queries (common in TypeScript/JavaScript)
  - Identify async operations in loops that could be batched (await in loops is a red flag)
  - Review recursive functions that might trigger multiple queries
  - Check `TelegramMessageJob` for loops processing multiple updates sequentially
  - Review any batch processing logic that might query data per item
- [ ] Check for unnecessary queries in loops
  - Verify if data fetched in loops could be prefetched before the loop (e.g., fetch all SystemSettings needed upfront)
  - Check if queries inside loops could be moved outside (e.g., configuration lookups)
  - Review if cached data could prevent repeated queries (e.g., SystemSetting values, bot client instances)
  - Identify queries that return unused data (fetching more than needed)
  - Check if loop iterations could be parallelized with Promise.all() instead of sequential await

### Batch Operation Opportunities

- [ ] Review batch operation possibilities
  - Check if multiple individual queries can be combined into batch queries (MCP supports multiple statements)
  - Verify if bulk operations are available for MCP database queries (e.g., batch UPDATE for tasks)
  - Review if batch endpoints exist for external APIs (Telegram doesn't support batch, but parallelization helps)
  - Check if Redis pipelining can batch multiple operations (MGET, MSET, pipeline)
  - Review if multiple SystemSetting lookups can be combined into a single query
- [ ] Identify optimization opportunities
  - Review if data can be prefetched before processing loops (e.g., fetch all SystemSettings at startup or per-request)
  - Check if JOINs or batch queries can replace multiple individual queries (MCP SQLite supports JOINs)
  - Verify if caching can prevent repeated queries (SystemSetting values, bot clients, etc.)
  - Review if parallel execution (Promise.all) can improve performance (independent API calls, file downloads)
  - Check if BullMQ job processing could batch operations when processing multiple jobs

### Documentation and Fixes

- [ ] Document identified N+1 patterns
  - List all identified N+1 query problems
  - Document the impact of each issue (query count, performance impact)
  - Prioritize fixes based on frequency and impact
  - Create a plan for fixing identified issues
- [ ] Implement fixes for critical N+1 patterns
  - Fix high-impact N+1 patterns (frequently executed, high query count)
  - Refactor loops to use batch operations where possible
  - Implement prefetching strategies where appropriate
  - Add batching for external API calls where supported

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
