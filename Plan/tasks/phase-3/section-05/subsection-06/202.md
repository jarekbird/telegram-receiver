# PHASE3-034: Create performance benchmarks

**Section**: 5. Performance Review
**Subsection**: 5.6
**Task ID**: PHASE3-034

## Description

Create performance benchmarks for the telegram-receiver application to establish baseline performance metrics and enable performance regression testing. This task involves setting up a benchmark test suite, measuring critical operations and API endpoints, documenting results, and establishing performance targets.

## Checklist

- [ ] Set up benchmark test suite infrastructure (using tools like `benchmark.js` or `autocannon`)
- [ ] Benchmark critical API endpoints:
  - [ ] POST `/telegram/webhook` - Webhook reception and job enqueueing
  - [ ] POST `/cursor-runner/callback` - Callback processing and response
  - [ ] GET `/health` - Health check endpoint
- [ ] Benchmark critical service operations:
  - [ ] TelegramService.sendMessage() - Message sending to Telegram API
  - [ ] TelegramService.downloadFile() - File downloading from Telegram
  - [ ] TelegramService.sendVoice() - Voice message sending to Telegram API
  - [ ] CursorRunnerService.execute() - Cursor Runner API calls (single execution)
  - [ ] CursorRunnerService.iterate() - Cursor Runner API calls (iterative execution, primary method for message forwarding)
  - [ ] CursorRunnerCallbackService operations - Redis state management
- [ ] Benchmark background job processing:
  - [ ] TelegramMessageJob processing time
  - [ ] Job queue throughput (jobs/second)
- [ ] Benchmark Redis operations:
  - [ ] State storage and retrieval
  - [ ] TTL-based cleanup operations
- [ ] Benchmark audio operations (if applicable):
  - [ ] ElevenLabs speech-to-text processing time (ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService.transcribe)
  - [ ] ElevenLabs text-to-speech processing time (ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService.synthesize)
- [ ] Document benchmark results with:
  - [ ] Baseline metrics (mean, median, p95, p99 response times)
  - [ ] Throughput measurements (requests/second)
  - [ ] Memory usage patterns
  - [ ] CPU usage patterns
- [ ] Set performance targets based on benchmarks:
  - [ ] Target response times for each endpoint
  - [ ] Target throughput for job processing
  - [ ] Target resource usage limits
- [ ] Create performance regression tests that:
  - [ ] Run benchmarks as part of CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Fail if performance degrades beyond thresholds
  - [ ] Track performance trends over time
- [ ] Save benchmark results and documentation to `docs/benchmarks.md` with:
  - [ ] Benchmark methodology
  - [ ] Test environment specifications
  - [ ] Baseline results
  - [ ] Performance targets
  - [ ] Instructions for running benchmarks

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Holistic Review and Best Practices
- Section: 5. Performance Review

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
