# PHASE3-039: Review secure credential handling

**Section**: 6. Security Review
**Subsection**: 6.4
**Task ID**: PHASE3-039

## Description

Review and improve secure credential handling in the codebase to ensure best practices. This task focuses on identifying and preventing credential exposure, ensuring credentials are stored securely, accessed safely, and never logged or exposed in error messages or responses.

## Rails Implementation Reference

The Rails application uses multiple credential management approaches:

1. **Rails Credentials** (`config/application.rb`):
   - Uses `Rails.application.credentials.dig()` for encrypted credential storage
   - Falls back to `ENV.fetch()` for backwards compatibility
   - Credentials include:
     - `webhook.secret` → `WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var
     - `telegram.bot_token` → `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` env var
     - `telegram.webhook_secret` → `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var
     - `telegram.webhook_base_url` → `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` env var
     - `elevenlabs.api_key` → `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` env var
     - `elevenlabs.stt_model_id` → `ELEVENLABS_STT_MODEL_ID` env var
     - `elevenlabs.tts_model_id` → `ELEVENLABS_TTS_MODEL_ID` env var
     - `elevenlabs.voice_id` → `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` env var

2. **GitCredential Model** (`app/models/git_credential.rb`):
   - Uses ActiveRecord encryption: `encrypts :password, :token`
   - Stores encrypted credentials in database
   - Provides `environment_variables` method for passing to cursor commands
   - Validates authentication methods (token or username/password)

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - All sensitive values should come from environment variables
   - Default values should be safe (e.g., `'changeme'` for webhook secret, not actual secrets)
   - Required credentials should fail fast if missing (no silent failures)

4. **Logging Practices**:
   - Rails services log errors but should not log credential values
   - Error messages should not expose tokens or secrets
   - Parameters logged should exclude sensitive fields
   - **Note**: In `telegram_controller.rb`, debug logging in test environment logs admin secrets (lines 122-126) - this pattern should be avoided or masked
   - **Note**: Bot token is embedded in Telegram file download URLs (Telegram API requirement) - ensure URLs are not logged or are masked in logs

## Checklist

### Environment Variable Usage

- [ ] Review all environment variable access patterns
  - [ ] Verify all credentials are read from `process.env` (not hardcoded)
  - [ ] Check that environment variables are accessed through a centralized config module
  - [ ] Verify default values are safe (e.g., empty strings, not actual secrets)
  - [ ] Check that required credentials fail fast if missing (throw error, don't silently continue)
  - [ ] Verify environment variable names match Rails conventions where applicable
  - [ ] Check for typos in environment variable names

- [ ] Review credential types used:
  - [ ] `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Telegram Bot API token
  - [ ] `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook secret token for Telegram
  - [ ] `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` - Base URL for webhook (not sensitive but should be validated)
  - [ ] `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Admin webhook secret
  - [ ] `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - ElevenLabs API key for speech services
  - [ ] `ELEVENLABS_STT_MODEL_ID` - Speech-to-text model ID
  - [ ] `ELEVENLABS_TTS_MODEL_ID` - Text-to-speech model ID
  - [ ] `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` - Voice ID for TTS
  - [ ] `CURSOR_RUNNER_URL` - URL for cursor-runner service (not sensitive but should be validated)
  - [ ] `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection URL (may contain password)
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection URL (may contain password)

### Hardcoded Secrets

- [ ] Search codebase for hardcoded secrets
  - [ ] Search for common secret patterns (tokens, keys, passwords)
  - [ ] Check for API keys in source code
  - [ ] Check for tokens in configuration files
  - [ ] Verify `.env` files are in `.gitignore` (not committed)
  - [ ] Check that `.env.example` doesn't contain real secrets
  - [ ] Verify no secrets in test files (use mock/test values)
  - [ ] Check Docker files for hardcoded secrets
  - [ ] Review any configuration files for embedded secrets

### Credential Storage

- [ ] Review how credentials are stored
  - [ ] Verify credentials are never stored in code
  - [ ] Verify credentials are never stored in version control
  - [ ] Check if database storage is needed (like GitCredential model)
  - [ ] If database storage is needed, verify encryption is used
  - [ ] Review credential access patterns (should be read-only after initialization)
  - [ ] Check for credential rotation mechanisms (if applicable)

- [ ] Review GitCredential model conversion (if applicable)
  - [ ] Verify password/token fields are encrypted at rest
  - [ ] Verify encryption keys are managed securely
  - [ ] Check that credentials are never returned in API responses
  - [ ] Verify `environment_variables` method doesn't expose secrets unnecessarily

### Credential Exposure in Logs

- [ ] Review all logging statements
  - [ ] Search for `console.log`, `logger.info`, `logger.error`, etc.
  - [ ] Verify credentials are never logged
  - [ ] Check error messages don't expose tokens or secrets
  - [ ] Verify request/response logging excludes sensitive headers
  - [ ] Check that API responses don't include credentials
  - [ ] Review stack traces for credential exposure
  - [ ] Verify debug logging doesn't expose credentials

- [ ] Review specific logging scenarios:
  - [ ] Telegram service logging (should not log bot token)
  - [ ] Cursor runner service logging (should not log API keys)
  - [ ] Error logging (should not include credentials in error messages)
  - [ ] Request logging (should mask sensitive headers like `Authorization`)
  - [ ] Configuration logging (should not log credential values)
  - [ ] Debug/test logging (should not log secrets even in test/debug mode - mask or exclude)
  - [ ] URL logging (Telegram file download URLs contain bot token - mask token in URLs if logged)
  - [ ] Authentication failure logging (should not log actual secret values, only indicate failure)

### API Key Handling

- [ ] Review API key usage patterns
  - [ ] Verify API keys are passed in headers (not URL parameters)
  - [ ] Check that API keys are never exposed in URLs
  - [ ] Verify API keys are validated before use
  - [ ] Check for API key rotation support (if applicable)
  - [ ] Review API key error handling (don't expose keys in errors)

- [ ] Review specific API integrations:
  - [ ] Telegram Bot API (bot token in headers for API calls, but required in URL for file downloads - ensure URLs are not logged or are masked)
  - [ ] ElevenLabs API (API key in headers)
  - [ ] Cursor runner API (verify no credentials in URLs)
  - [ ] Redis connection (password in URL, verify it's not logged)
  - [ ] Database connection (password in DATABASE_URL, verify it's not logged)

### Environment Variable Validation

- [ ] Review environment variable validation
  - [ ] Verify required credentials are validated at startup
  - [ ] Check that missing credentials cause clear error messages
  - [ ] Verify credential format validation (if applicable)
  - [ ] Check for credential length validation (prevent injection)
  - [ ] Review environment variable sanitization

### Configuration Management

- [ ] Review configuration module structure
  - [ ] Verify centralized configuration module exists
  - [ ] Check that config is read-only after initialization
  - [ ] Verify config values are validated on load
  - [ ] Check for config caching (credentials shouldn't be cached unsafely)
  - [ ] Review config access patterns (should be through getters, not direct env access)

### Security Issues Identification

- [ ] Identify potential security vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Check for credential exposure in error messages
  - [ ] Check for credential exposure in API responses
  - [ ] Check for credential exposure in logs
  - [ ] Check for credential exposure in stack traces
  - [ ] Check for credential exposure in debug output
  - [ ] Check for credential exposure in test/debug logging (even test logs should mask secrets)
  - [ ] Check for credential exposure in URLs (especially Telegram file download URLs)
  - [ ] Verify credentials are not passed to untrusted code
  - [ ] Check for credential leakage through side channels (timing attacks, etc.)
  - [ ] Verify authentication failure messages don't reveal secret values (only indicate success/failure)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
