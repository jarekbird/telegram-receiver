# PHASE3-038: Review SQL and Redis injection prevention

**Section**: 6. Security Review
**Subsection**: 6.3
**Task ID**: PHASE3-038

## Description

Review and improve SQL injection prevention (if applicable) and Redis injection prevention in the codebase to ensure best practices. This task focuses on identifying and preventing injection vulnerabilities in database queries and Redis operations, ensuring that user-controlled input is properly sanitized and parameterized.

## Rails Implementation Reference

The Rails application uses both SQLite3 (via ActiveRecord) and Redis for different purposes:

### SQL Database Usage (SQLite3)

The application uses SQLite3 database with ActiveRecord ORM for persistent data storage:

1. **Database Configuration** (`config/database.yml`):
   - Uses SQLite3 adapter
   - Development: `db/development.sqlite3` (or `SHARED_DB_PATH` if set)
   - Production: `/app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3` (or `SHARED_DB_PATH` if set)

2. **ActiveRecord Models**:
   - **SystemSetting** (`app/models/system_setting.rb`):
     - Stores system-wide boolean settings
     - Methods: `get(name)`, `set(name, value)`, `enabled?(name)`, `disabled?(name)`, `enable(name)`, `disable(name)`, `toggle(name)`
     - Uses `find_by(name: name)` and `find_or_initialize_by(name: name)` - safe from SQL injection (ActiveRecord parameterizes)
     - Used in: `TelegramMessageJob`, `CursorRunnerCallbackController`
   - **TelegramBot** (`app/models/telegram_bot.rb`):
     - Manages multiple Telegram bots with tokens and webhook secrets
     - Methods: `find_by_webhook_secret(secret)`, `find_by_bot_token(token)`
     - Uses `active.find_by(webhook_secret: secret)` and `active.find_by(bot_token: token)` - safe from SQL injection
     - Scopes: `active`, `by_type`, `virtual_assistants`, `product_specs_bots`
   - **GitCredential** (`app/models/git_credential.rb`):
     - Stores encrypted git credentials for cursor-cli commands
     - Method: `find_for_repository(repository_url)`
     - Uses `active.find_by(repository_url: repository_url)` - safe from SQL injection
     - Scopes: `active`, `for_repository`

3. **SQL Injection Safety**:
   - All ActiveRecord queries use parameterized methods (`find_by`, `where`, etc.)
   - No raw SQL queries found in the codebase
   - ActiveRecord automatically escapes parameters, preventing SQL injection
   - However, should verify no dynamic SQL construction or string interpolation in queries

### Redis Usage

The application uses Redis for temporary state management:

1. **CursorRunnerCallbackService** (`app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb`):
   - Uses Redis for storing callback state
   - Key construction: `"#{REDIS_KEY_PREFIX}#{request_id}"` where `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX = 'cursor_runner_callback:'`
   - Redis commands: `setex`, `get`, `del`
   - JSON serialization: `data.to_json`
   - Potential vulnerability: If `request_id` contains special characters, it could affect key construction
   - No explicit validation or sanitization of `request_id` before key construction

2. **Redis Key Patterns**:
   - Keys are constructed by concatenating prefix with user-provided `request_id`
   - Redis commands are called with constructed keys directly
   - Used for temporary storage of pending cursor-runner requests (TTL: 1 hour default)

3. **Sidekiq Background Jobs**:
   - Redis is also used by Sidekiq for background job processing
   - Configuration in `config/initializers/sidekiq.rb`
   - Uses `REDIS_URL` environment variable (default: `redis://localhost:6379/0`)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
