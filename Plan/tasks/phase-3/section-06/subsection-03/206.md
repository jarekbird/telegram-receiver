# PHASE3-038: Review SQL and Redis injection prevention

**Section**: 6. Security Review
**Subsection**: 6.3
**Task ID**: PHASE3-038

## Description

Review and improve SQL injection prevention (if applicable) and Redis injection prevention in the codebase to ensure best practices. This task focuses on identifying and preventing injection vulnerabilities in database queries and Redis operations, ensuring that user-controlled input is properly sanitized and parameterized.

## Rails Implementation Reference

The Rails application uses both SQLite3 (via ActiveRecord) and Redis for different purposes:

### SQL Database Usage (SQLite3)

The application uses SQLite3 database with ActiveRecord ORM for persistent data storage:

1. **Database Configuration** (`config/database.yml`):
   - Uses SQLite3 adapter
   - Development: `db/development.sqlite3` (or `SHARED_DB_PATH` if set)
   - Production: `/app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3` (or `SHARED_DB_PATH` if set)

2. **ActiveRecord Models**:
   - **SystemSetting** (`app/models/system_setting.rb`):
     - Stores system-wide boolean settings
     - Methods: `get(name)`, `set(name, value)`, `enabled?(name)`, `disabled?(name)`, `enable(name)`, `disable(name)`, `toggle(name)`
     - Uses `find_by(name: name)` and `find_or_initialize_by(name: name)` - safe from SQL injection (ActiveRecord parameterizes)
     - Used in: `TelegramMessageJob`, `CursorRunnerCallbackController`
   - **TelegramBot** (`app/models/telegram_bot.rb`):
     - Manages multiple Telegram bots with tokens and webhook secrets
     - Methods: `find_by_webhook_secret(secret)`, `find_by_bot_token(token)`
     - Uses `active.find_by(webhook_secret: secret)` and `active.find_by(bot_token: token)` - safe from SQL injection
     - Scopes: `active`, `by_type`, `virtual_assistants`, `product_specs_bots`
   - **GitCredential** (`app/models/git_credential.rb`):
     - Stores encrypted git credentials for cursor-cli commands
     - Method: `find_for_repository(repository_url)`
     - Uses `active.find_by(repository_url: repository_url)` - safe from SQL injection
     - Scopes: `active`, `for_repository`

3. **SQL Injection Safety**:
   - All ActiveRecord queries use parameterized methods (`find_by`, `where`, etc.)
   - No raw SQL queries found in the codebase
   - ActiveRecord automatically escapes parameters, preventing SQL injection
   - However, should verify no dynamic SQL construction or string interpolation in queries

### Redis Usage

The application uses Redis for temporary state management:

1. **CursorRunnerCallbackService** (`app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb`):
   - Uses Redis for storing callback state
   - Key construction: `"#{REDIS_KEY_PREFIX}#{request_id}"` where `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX = 'cursor_runner_callback:'`
   - Redis commands: `setex`, `get`, `del`
   - JSON serialization: `data.to_json`
   - Potential vulnerability: If `request_id` contains special characters, it could affect key construction
   - No explicit validation or sanitization of `request_id` before key construction

2. **Redis Key Patterns**:
   - Keys are constructed by concatenating prefix with user-provided `request_id`
   - Redis commands are called with constructed keys directly
   - Used for temporary storage of pending cursor-runner requests (TTL: 1 hour default)

3. **Sidekiq Background Jobs**:
   - Redis is also used by Sidekiq for background job processing
   - Configuration in `config/initializers/sidekiq.rb`
   - Uses `REDIS_URL` environment variable (default: `redis://localhost:6379/0`)

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
