# PHASE2-021: Implement delete_webhook method

**Section**: 4. TelegramService Conversion
**Subsection**: 4.4
**Task ID**: PHASE2-021

## Description

Convert and implement the `delete_webhook` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`.

The method should delete the Telegram webhook by calling the Telegram Bot API's `deleteWebhook` endpoint. This method follows the same pattern as other TelegramService methods: it checks for a blank bot token before proceeding, handles errors with logging, and re-raises exceptions.

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `deleteWebhook` method in TelegramService
- [ ] Add early return check if telegram bot token is blank (consistent with other methods)
- [ ] Call Telegram Bot API `deleteWebhook` endpoint (no parameters required)
- [ ] Add error handling with try-catch block
- [ ] Log errors with descriptive error message ("Error deleting Telegram webhook: {error message}")
- [ ] Log error stack trace for debugging
- [ ] Re-raise exceptions after logging (to allow callers to handle errors)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 4. TelegramService Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation in `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` (lines 53-63) for exact behavior

### Implementation Details

- The method should be a static/class method (matching the Rails class method pattern)
- The method takes no parameters (unlike `set_webhook` which takes `url` and optional `secret_token`)
- The method should check if the telegram bot token is blank before proceeding (early return)
- Error handling should:
  - Catch all exceptions (StandardError in Rails, Error in TypeScript)
  - Log the error message with prefix "Error deleting Telegram webhook: "
  - Log the full stack trace for debugging
  - Re-raise the exception to allow callers to handle errors appropriately
- The method should use the Telegram Bot API client's `deleteWebhook` method (or equivalent HTTP call)
- Follow the same pattern as `setWebhook` and `webhookInfo` methods for consistency
- Return value: The method should return the result of the API call (or void/undefined if no meaningful return value). When the bot token is blank, the method should return early (undefined/void)
- Early return behavior: If the telegram bot token is blank, return early without making the API call (consistent with other TelegramService methods)

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
