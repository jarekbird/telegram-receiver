# PHASE2-022: Implement webhook_info method

**Section**: 4. TelegramService Conversion
**Subsection**: 4.5
**Task ID**: PHASE2-022

## Description

Convert and implement the `webhook_info` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` (lines 65-75).

The Rails implementation:

- Takes no parameters
- Returns `nil` (undefined in TypeScript) early if bot token is blank (similar to other methods in the service)
- Calls Telegram Bot API `getWebhookInfo` endpoint via `bot.api.get_webhook_info`
- Logs errors with full stack trace and re-raises exceptions (using `raise` in Rails, `throw` in TypeScript)
- Returns the full Telegram API response object (implicit return of `bot.api.get_webhook_info` result, which includes `ok` boolean and `result` field containing webhook information)

The method should retrieve the current Telegram webhook information by calling the Telegram Bot API's `getWebhookInfo` endpoint. This method follows the same pattern as other TelegramService methods: it checks for a blank bot token before proceeding (returning `undefined` early), handles errors with logging, and re-raises exceptions. The method returns the full Telegram API response object, which includes an `ok` boolean and a `result` field containing webhook details such as the webhook URL, pending update count, last error date, and other webhook-related information.

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `getWebhookInfo` method in TelegramService with proper TypeScript signature:
  - Parameters: none
  - Return type: `Promise<TelegramApiResponse<WebhookInfo> | undefined>` (returns `undefined` on early return when bot token is blank, otherwise returns Telegram API response)
- [ ] Add early return check if telegram bot token is blank (consistent with other methods)
  - If bot token is blank/invalid, return `undefined` immediately (matching Rails `return` behavior which returns `nil`)
- [ ] Call Telegram Bot API `getWebhookInfo` endpoint (no parameters required)
- [ ] Add error handling with try-catch block
- [ ] Log errors with descriptive error message ("Error getting Telegram webhook info: {error message}")
- [ ] Log error stack trace for debugging
- [ ] Re-raise exceptions after logging (to allow callers to handle errors)
- [ ] Return the full Telegram API response object (includes `ok` boolean and `result` field containing webhook info)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 4. TelegramService Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation in `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` (lines 65-75) for exact behavior

### Implementation Details

- The method should be a static/class method (matching the Rails class method pattern)
- The method takes no parameters
- The method should check if the telegram bot token is blank before proceeding (early return)
- Return value: The method should return the full Telegram API response object (with `ok` boolean and `result` field) when successful, or `undefined` when the bot token is blank (early return). The Rails method implicitly returns the result of `bot.api.get_webhook_info` which is the full API response object.
- Early return behavior: If the telegram bot token is blank, return `undefined` early without making the API call (consistent with other TelegramService methods, matching Rails `return` which returns `nil`)
- Error handling should:
  - Catch all exceptions (StandardError in Rails, Error in TypeScript)
  - Log the error message with prefix "Error getting Telegram webhook info: "
  - Log the full stack trace for debugging
  - Re-raise the exception to allow callers to handle errors appropriately (using `throw` in TypeScript, matching Rails `raise` behavior)
- The method should use the Telegram Bot API client's `getWebhookInfo` method (or equivalent HTTP call)
- The Telegram API response structure includes:
  - `ok`: Boolean indicating success
  - `result`: Object containing webhook information with fields:
    - `url`: The webhook URL (if set)
    - `has_custom_certificate`: Whether a custom certificate is used
    - `pending_update_count`: Number of pending updates
    - `last_error_date`: Timestamp of last error (if any)
    - `last_error_message`: Last error message (if any)
    - `max_connections`: Maximum allowed connections
    - `allowed_updates`: Array of allowed update types
- Follow the same pattern as `setWebhook` and `deleteWebhook` methods for consistency

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
