# PHASE2-022: Implement webhook_info method

**Section**: 4. TelegramService Conversion
**Subsection**: 4.5
**Task ID**: PHASE2-022

## Description

Convert and implement the `webhook_info` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` (lines 65-75).

The Rails implementation:

- Takes no parameters
- Returns `nil` (undefined in TypeScript) early if bot token is blank (similar to other methods in the service)
- Calls Telegram Bot API `getWebhookInfo` endpoint via `bot.api.get_webhook_info`
- Logs errors with full stack trace and re-raises exceptions (using `raise` in Rails, `throw` in TypeScript)
- Returns the full Telegram API response object (implicit return of `bot.api.get_webhook_info` result, which includes `ok` boolean and `result` field containing webhook information)

The method should retrieve the current Telegram webhook information by calling the Telegram Bot API's `getWebhookInfo` endpoint. This method follows the same pattern as other TelegramService methods: it checks for a blank bot token before proceeding (returning `undefined` early), handles errors with logging, and re-raises exceptions. The method returns the full Telegram API response object, which includes an `ok` boolean and a `result` field containing webhook details such as the webhook URL, pending update count, last error date, and other webhook-related information.

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `getWebhookInfo` method in TelegramService with proper TypeScript signature:
  - Parameters: none
  - Return type: `Promise<TelegramApiResponse<WebhookInfo> | undefined>` (returns `undefined` on early return when bot token is blank, otherwise returns Telegram API response)
- [ ] Add early return check if telegram bot token is blank (consistent with other methods)
  - If bot token is blank/invalid, return `undefined` immediately (matching Rails `return` behavior which returns `nil`)
- [ ] Call Telegram Bot API `getWebhookInfo` endpoint (no parameters required)
- [ ] Add error handling with try-catch block
- [ ] Log errors with descriptive error message ("Error getting Telegram webhook info: {error message}")
- [ ] Log error stack trace for debugging
- [ ] Re-raise exceptions after logging (to allow callers to handle errors)
- [ ] Return the full Telegram API response object (includes `ok` boolean and `result` field containing webhook info)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 4. TelegramService Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation in `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` (lines 65-75) for exact behavior

### Implementation Details

- The method should be a static/class method (matching the Rails class method pattern)
- The method takes no parameters
- The method should check if the telegram bot token is blank before proceeding (early return)
- Return value: The method should return the full Telegram API response object (with `ok` boolean and `result` field) when successful, or `undefined` when the bot token is blank (early return). The Rails method implicitly returns the result of `bot.api.get_webhook_info` which is the full API response object.
- Early return behavior: If the telegram bot token is blank, return `undefined` early without making the API call (consistent with other TelegramService methods, matching Rails `return` which returns `nil`)
- Error handling should:
  - Catch all exceptions (StandardError in Rails, Error in TypeScript)
  - Log the error message with prefix "Error getting Telegram webhook info: "
  - Log the full stack trace for debugging
  - Re-raise the exception to allow callers to handle errors appropriately (using `throw` in TypeScript, matching Rails `raise` behavior)
- The method should use the Telegram Bot API client's `getWebhookInfo` method (or equivalent HTTP call)
- The Telegram API response structure includes:
  - `ok`: Boolean indicating success
  - `result`: Object containing webhook information with fields:
    - `url`: The webhook URL (if set)
    - `has_custom_certificate`: Whether a custom certificate is used
    - `pending_update_count`: Number of pending updates
    - `last_error_date`: Timestamp of last error (if any)
    - `last_error_message`: Last error message (if any)
    - `max_connections`: Maximum allowed connections
    - `allowed_updates`: Array of allowed update types
- Follow the same pattern as `setWebhook` and `deleteWebhook` methods for consistency

- Next: PHASE2-023

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
