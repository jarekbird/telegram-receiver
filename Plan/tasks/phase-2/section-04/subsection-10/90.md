# PHASE2-027: Write TelegramService unit tests

**Section**: 4. TelegramService Conversion
**Subsection**: 4.10
**Task ID**: PHASE2-027

## Description

Write comprehensive unit tests for TelegramService in TypeScript/Node.js. The tests should cover all public methods, error handling, edge cases, and private helper methods. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` for the Rails implementation behavior.

The Rails TelegramService (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`) has the following public methods that need to be tested:

- `send_message()` - sends text messages with HTML escaping support
- `set_webhook()` - sets Telegram webhook URL with optional secret token
- `delete_webhook()` - deletes the Telegram webhook
- `webhook_info()` - gets current webhook information
- `send_voice()` - sends voice/audio files with file validation
- `download_file()` - downloads files from Telegram with file path handling

Private methods that should also be tested:

- `download_file_from_url()` - HTTP file download with response validation
- `escape_html_entities()` - HTML entity escaping for message text

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `tests/unit/services/telegramService.test.ts` (use camelCase naming convention)
- [ ] Set up proper mocks for Telegram Bot API (use existing `tests/mocks/telegramApi.ts` as reference)
  - [ ] Add missing mock methods to `tests/mocks/telegramApi.ts`: `getWebhookInfo`, `sendVoice`, `getFile`
- [ ] Mock file system operations (fs, path modules) for file-related tests
- [ ] Mock HTTP client for `download_file_from_url()` tests
- [ ] Test `sendMessage()` method:
  - [ ] Successfully sends message with all parameters
  - [ ] Handles HTML parse mode with entity escaping (`escape_html_entities`)
  - [ ] Handles non-HTML parse modes (Markdown, plain text)
  - [ ] Handles optional `reply_to_message_id` parameter
  - [ ] Returns early when bot token is blank
  - [ ] Logs errors and re-throws exceptions on failure
- [ ] Test `setWebhook()` method:
  - [ ] Successfully sets webhook with URL
  - [ ] Handles optional `secret_token` parameter
  - [ ] Returns early when bot token is blank
  - [ ] Logs errors and re-throws exceptions on failure
- [ ] Test `deleteWebhook()` method:
  - [ ] Successfully deletes webhook
  - [ ] Returns early when bot token is blank
  - [ ] Logs errors and re-throws exceptions on failure
- [ ] Test `getWebhookInfo()` method:
  - [ ] Successfully retrieves webhook info
  - [ ] Returns early when bot token is blank
  - [ ] Logs errors and re-throws exceptions on failure
- [ ] Test `sendVoice()` method:
  - [ ] Successfully sends voice file with all parameters
  - [ ] Validates file exists before sending (throws error if file missing)
  - [ ] Handles different file types and sets correct MIME types (.ogg/.oga → audio/ogg, .wav → audio/wav, others → audio/mpeg)
  - [ ] Handles optional `reply_to_message_id` parameter
  - [ ] Handles optional `caption` parameter
  - [ ] Returns early when bot token is blank
  - [ ] Logs errors and re-throws exceptions on failure
- [ ] Test `downloadFile()` method:
  - [ ] Successfully downloads file with provided destination path
  - [ ] Calls `getFile()` API method first to retrieve file path from Telegram
  - [ ] Constructs correct download URL using bot token and file path
  - [ ] Generates default destination path in temp directory when not provided
  - [ ] Uses correct filename from Telegram file path (format: `telegram_{file_id}_{filename}`)
  - [ ] Calls `download_file_from_url()` with correct URL
  - [ ] Returns the destination path after successful download
  - [ ] Returns early when bot token is blank
  - [ ] Logs errors and re-throws exceptions on failure
- [ ] Test `downloadFileFromUrl()` private method (if exposed for testing or test via `downloadFile()`):
  - [ ] Successfully downloads file from URL
  - [ ] Validates HTTP response is successful (throws error if not HTTPSuccess)
  - [ ] Creates destination directory if it doesn't exist
  - [ ] Writes file content correctly
  - [ ] Logs download progress
- [ ] Test `escapeHtmlEntities()` private method (if exposed for testing or test via `sendMessage()`):
  - [ ] Escapes `&` to `&amp;` (must be first to avoid double-escaping)
  - [ ] Escapes `<` to `&lt;`
  - [ ] Escapes `>` to `&gt;`
  - [ ] Handles string conversion for non-string inputs
- [ ] Test error handling across all methods:
  - [ ] All methods catch and log errors with descriptive messages
  - [ ] All methods log full stack traces
  - [ ] All methods re-throw exceptions after logging (maintains error propagation)
  - [ ] Error messages follow pattern: "Error {operation}: {error message}"
- [ ] Test early return behavior:
  - [ ] All methods return early (undefined/null) when bot token is blank
  - [ ] No API calls are made when token is blank
- [ ] Achieve >80% code coverage
- [ ] Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) in all tests
- [ ] Use descriptive test names that clearly describe what is being tested

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 4. TelegramService Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`) for exact behavior and error handling patterns
- The Rails implementation uses consistent error handling:
  - All methods wrap operations in `begin/rescue/end` blocks
  - All methods log errors with `Rails.logger.error` and full stack traces
  - All methods re-raise exceptions after logging using `raise`
  - All methods check for blank bot token before proceeding (early return pattern)
- Specific validations from Rails:
  - `send_voice` (line 87): Validates file exists with `raise 'Voice file does not exist' unless File.exist?(voice_path)`
  - `download_file_from_url` (line 166): Validates HTTP response with `raise "Failed to download file: HTTP #{response.code} #{response.message}" unless response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)`
- HTML escaping in `send_message` (lines 20-24): Only escapes HTML entities when `parse_mode == 'HTML'`, otherwise uses text as-is
- File MIME type detection in `send_voice` (lines 93-100): Maps file extensions to MIME types (.ogg/.oga → audio/ogg, .wav → audio/wav, default → audio/mpeg)
- Default destination path generation in `download_file` (lines 135-139): Uses temp directory with format `telegram_{file_id}_{filename}` when destination_path is not provided
- File download flow in `download_file` (lines 127-143):
  - First calls `bot.api.get_file(file_id: file_id)` to get file info (line 128)
  - Extracts `file_path` from response: `file_info['result']['file_path']` (line 129)
  - Constructs download URL: `https://api.telegram.org/file/bot{token}/{file_path}` (line 132)
  - Logs download start with file ID and destination path (line 142)
  - Calls `download_file_from_url()` to perform actual download (line 143)
  - Returns destination path after successful download (line 145)
- Method naming: The Rails method `webhook_info` calls Telegram API `get_webhook_info`. In TypeScript, use `getWebhookInfo()` to match Telegram API naming convention (or `webhookInfo()` per API conventions doc - verify which naming is used in the actual implementation)
- Use existing test infrastructure:
  - Use `tests/mocks/telegramApi.ts` as reference for mocking Telegram API
  - **IMPORTANT**: The mock file currently lacks `getWebhookInfo`, `sendVoice`, and `getFile` methods - these must be added before writing tests
  - Follow patterns in `tests/README.md` for test structure
  - Use Jest for testing framework
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
