# PHASE2-018: Create TelegramService class structure

**Section**: 4. TelegramService Conversion
**Subsection**: 4.1
**Task ID**: PHASE2-018

## Description

Create the TelegramService class structure in TypeScript/Node.js. This is the foundational task that sets up the class skeleton. Method implementations will be added in subsequent tasks (PHASE2-019 through PHASE2-025).

The Rails implementation (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`) uses class methods (`class << self`) and includes:

- A `bot` method that creates/returns a Telegram::Bot::Client instance (memoized with `@bot ||=`)
- Bot token configuration via `Rails.application.config.telegram_bot_token`
- All methods check if bot token is blank before proceeding (early return pattern)
- 6 public methods: `send_message`, `set_webhook`, `delete_webhook`, `webhook_info`, `send_voice`, `download_file`
- 2 private helper methods: `download_file_from_url`, `escape_html_entities`
- Consistent error handling: all methods use `begin/rescue` blocks, log errors with full stack trace via `Rails.logger.error`, and re-raise exceptions
- Dependencies: `telegram/bot` gem, `faraday` (for UploadIO in send_voice), `stringio`, `net/http`, `uri`, `fileutils`

For TypeScript, convert to an instance-based class that:

- Accepts bot token via constructor or environment variable (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`)
- Validates bot token presence before operations (similar to Rails blank check)
- Will have method stubs added in subsequent tasks

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/services/telegram-service.ts` file
- [ ] Define `TelegramService` class
- [ ] Add private `botToken` property to store the Telegram bot token
- [ ] Add constructor that accepts bot token (or reads from `process.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`)
- [ ] Add private method to validate bot token is present (similar to Rails blank check)
- [ ] Add placeholder for Telegram Bot API client initialization (will use axios for HTTP requests)
- [ ] Import required types and dependencies:
  - `axios` for HTTP requests to Telegram Bot API
  - `fs` (Node.js `fs/promises` or `fs`) for file operations (needed for sendVoice and downloadFile)
  - `path` (Node.js `path`) for path operations
  - `os` (Node.js `os`) for temp directory access (`os.tmpdir()`)
  - FormData or similar for multipart uploads in sendVoice (Node.js built-in `FormData` or `form-data` package)
  - Types for Telegram API responses (can use `any` or define interfaces)
- [ ] Add method stubs with proper TypeScript signatures for:
  - `sendMessage(chatId: number | string, text: string, parseMode?: string, replyToMessageId?: number): Promise<any>` - will be implemented in PHASE2-019
  - `setWebhook(url: string, secretToken?: string): Promise<any>` - will be implemented in PHASE2-020
  - `deleteWebhook(): Promise<any>` - will be implemented in PHASE2-021
  - `getWebhookInfo(): Promise<any>` - will be implemented in PHASE2-022 (Rails method is `webhook_info` which calls `bot.api.get_webhook_info`)
  - `sendVoice(chatId: number | string, voicePath: string, replyToMessageId?: number, caption?: string): Promise<any>` - will be implemented in PHASE2-023 (needs file reading, MIME type detection, multipart upload)
  - `downloadFile(fileId: string, destinationPath?: string): Promise<string>` - will be implemented in PHASE2-024 (two-step process: get_file then download, temp directory fallback)
- [ ] Add private method stubs for helper methods:
  - `downloadFileFromUrl(url: string, destinationPath: string): Promise<void>` - helper for downloading files from URLs (used by downloadFile)
  - `escapeHtmlEntities(text: string): string` - helper for HTML escaping (used by sendMessage when parseMode is 'HTML', will be implemented in PHASE2-025)
- [ ] Add consistent error handling structure:
  - All methods should follow the same pattern: early return if token is blank, try-catch block, log error with message and stack trace, re-raise exception
  - Use `console.error` for error logging (or application logger if one exists) - log both error message and stack trace
  - Maintain Rails behavior: log errors but re-raise exceptions to allow callers to handle them
- [ ] Export the class as default export

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 4. TelegramService Conversion
- **This task only creates the class structure** - method implementations are in subsequent tasks
- Reference the Rails implementation (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`) for behavior patterns
- The Rails service uses class methods (`class << self`), but TypeScript version should use instance methods
- Bot token should be validated in each method (similar to Rails `return if Rails.application.config.telegram_bot_token.blank?`)
- Use `axios` (already in dependencies) for HTTP requests to Telegram Bot API
- Method names should follow TypeScript/JavaScript camelCase convention (e.g., `sendMessage` instead of `send_message`)
- **Error Handling Pattern**: All methods follow the same pattern:
  - Early return if bot token is blank
  - Wrap operations in try-catch block
  - Log errors with descriptive message and full stack trace
  - Re-raise exceptions after logging (maintains Rails behavior)
- **Dependencies Needed**:
  - `axios` for HTTP requests (already in package.json)
  - Node.js built-in modules: `fs`/`fs/promises` (file operations), `path` (path operations), `os` (temp directory), `FormData` (multipart uploads)
- **Method-Specific Notes**:
  - `sendVoice`: Will need file existence check, binary file reading, MIME type detection based on file extension (.ogg/.oga → 'audio/ogg', .wav → 'audio/wav', default → 'audio/mpeg'), and multipart form data upload
  - `downloadFile`: Two-step process - first call `get_file` API to get file path, then construct download URL and download file. If `destinationPath` is not provided, use temp directory with pattern `telegram_{fileId}_{filename}`
  - `getWebhookInfo`: Rails method name is `webhook_info` but it calls `bot.api.get_webhook_info` - TypeScript method should be `getWebhookInfo` to match Telegram API naming
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

- Next: PHASE2-019

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
