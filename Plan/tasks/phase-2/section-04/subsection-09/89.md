# PHASE2-026: Add comprehensive error handling to TelegramService

**Section**: 4. TelegramService Conversion
**Subsection**: 4.9
**Task ID**: PHASE2-026

## Description

Review and ensure comprehensive error handling is implemented across all TelegramService methods, matching the Rails implementation patterns. This task consolidates error handling requirements and ensures consistency across all methods. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`.

The Rails implementation uses consistent error handling patterns:

- All public methods (`send_message`, `set_webhook`, `delete_webhook`, `webhook_info`, `send_voice`, `download_file`) wrap operations in `begin/rescue/end` blocks
- All methods log errors with descriptive messages and full stack traces using `Rails.logger.error`
- All methods re-raise exceptions after logging (using `raise`)
- Specific validations include file existence checks (`send_voice`) and HTTP response validation (`download_file_from_url`)
- All methods check for blank bot token before proceeding (early return pattern)

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify all public methods have try-catch blocks:
  - [ ] `sendMessage()` - wrap Telegram API call in try-catch
  - [ ] `setWebhook()` - wrap Telegram API call in try-catch
  - [ ] `deleteWebhook()` - wrap Telegram API call in try-catch
  - [ ] `getWebhookInfo()` - wrap Telegram API call in try-catch
  - [ ] `sendVoice()` - wrap file operations and Telegram API call in try-catch
  - [ ] `downloadFile()` - wrap file operations and Telegram API call in try-catch
- [ ] Verify all methods log errors appropriately:
  - [ ] Log error messages with descriptive context (e.g., "Error sending Telegram message: {error message}")
  - [ ] Log full stack traces for debugging
  - [ ] Use appropriate logging level (error level)
- [ ] Verify all methods re-throw exceptions after logging (maintain Rails behavior of propagating errors)
- [ ] Verify specific error validations are implemented:
  - [ ] `sendVoice()` validates file exists before reading (throw error: "Voice file does not exist" if file missing)
  - [ ] `downloadFileFromUrl()` (private helper method) validates HTTP response is successful (throw error: "Failed to download file: HTTP {code} {message}" if not successful)
- [ ] Verify all methods have early return checks for blank bot token (consistent with Rails `return if Rails.application.config.telegram_bot_token.blank?` pattern)
- [ ] Ensure error handling is consistent across all methods (same pattern: try-catch, log, re-throw)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 4. TelegramService Conversion
- **This is a review/consolidation task** - it ensures error handling is comprehensive and consistent across all TelegramService methods
- Reference the Rails implementation (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`) for exact error handling patterns
- Error handling should match Rails behavior:
  - All methods use `begin/rescue/end` blocks (lines 17-36, 42-50, 56-62, 68-74, 86-116, 126-150)
  - Error messages follow pattern: "Error {operation}: {error message}" (e.g., "Error sending Telegram message:", "Error setting Telegram webhook:")
  - Full stack traces are logged using `Rails.logger.error(e.backtrace.join("\n"))`
  - Exceptions are re-raised after logging using `raise`
- Specific error validations from Rails:
  - `send_voice` (line 87): Validates file exists with `raise 'Voice file does not exist' unless File.exist?(voice_path)`
  - `download_file_from_url` (line 166): Validates HTTP response with `raise "Failed to download file: HTTP #{response.code} #{response.message}" unless response.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)`
- All methods check for blank bot token before proceeding (early return pattern, e.g., line 15, 40, 54, 66, 84, 124)
- This task should be completed after all individual method implementation tasks (PHASE2-019 through PHASE2-025) to ensure comprehensive error handling review
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Related Tasks

- Next: PHASE2-027

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
