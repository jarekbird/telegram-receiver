# PHASE2-020: Implement set_webhook method

**Section**: 4. TelegramService Conversion
**Subsection**: 4.3
**Task ID**: PHASE2-020

## Description

Convert and implement the `setWebhook` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` (lines 39-51).

The Rails implementation:

- Takes `url` (required) and optional `secret_token` parameter
- Returns `nil` (undefined in TypeScript) early if bot token is blank (similar to other methods in the service)
- Builds a params object with the `url`
- Conditionally adds `secret_token` to params only if it's present (not nil/blank, uses `.present?` check)
- Calls Telegram Bot API `setWebhook` endpoint via `bot.api.set_webhook(params)`
- Logs errors with full stack trace and re-raises exceptions (using `raise` in Rails, `throw` in TypeScript)
- Returns the API response from Telegram (implicit return of `bot.api.set_webhook(params)` result)

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `setWebhook` method with proper TypeScript signature:
  - Parameters: `url: string` (required), `secretToken?: string` (optional)
  - Return type: `Promise<TelegramApiResponse | undefined>` (returns `undefined` on early return when bot token is blank, otherwise returns Telegram API response)
- [ ] Add early return check if bot token is blank (use the validation method from PHASE2-018 - typically a private method like `isBotTokenValid()` or `validateBotToken()` that returns boolean)
  - If bot token is blank/invalid, return `undefined` immediately (matching Rails `return` behavior which returns `nil`)
- [ ] Build params object with `url` parameter
- [ ] Conditionally add `secret_token` to params only if `secretToken` is provided and not empty (check for truthy and non-empty string)
- [ ] Make HTTP request to Telegram Bot API `setWebhook` endpoint using axios:
  - Endpoint URL: `https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/setWebhook`
  - Method: POST
  - Request body: JSON with `url` and optionally `secret_token`
  - Response: Telegram API response object with `ok` boolean and `result` field
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling:
  - Wrap in try-catch block
  - Log errors with descriptive messages (include error message and stack trace)
  - Re-throw exceptions after logging using `throw` (maintains Rails `raise` behavior - allows callers to handle errors)
- [ ] Return the API response from Telegram (not webhook info - that's a separate method)
- [ ] Reference `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` lines 39-51 for exact behavior

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 4. TelegramService Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` lines 39-51) for exact behavior
- The `secret_token` parameter is optional and should only be included in the API request if provided and not empty (Rails uses `.present?` which checks for non-nil and non-blank)
- Error handling should match Rails pattern: log error details with full stack trace, then re-throw the exception
- Method should follow camelCase naming convention (`setWebhook` not `set_webhook`)
- This method sets the webhook URL, but does not return webhook info (that's handled by `getWebhookInfo` method in a separate task)
- The Rails method implicitly returns the result of `bot.api.set_webhook(params)` - TypeScript should explicitly return the axios response
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
