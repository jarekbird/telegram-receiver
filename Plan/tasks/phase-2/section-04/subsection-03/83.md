# PHASE2-020: Implement set_webhook method

**Section**: 4. TelegramService Conversion
**Subsection**: 4.3
**Task ID**: PHASE2-020

## Description

Convert and implement the `setWebhook` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` (lines 39-51).

The Rails implementation:

- Takes `url` (required) and optional `secret_token` parameter
- Returns `nil` (undefined in TypeScript) early if bot token is blank (similar to other methods in the service)
- Builds a params object with the `url`
- Conditionally adds `secret_token` to params only if it's present (not nil/blank, uses `.present?` check)
- Calls Telegram Bot API `setWebhook` endpoint via `bot.api.set_webhook(params)`
- Logs errors with full stack trace and re-raises exceptions (using `raise` in Rails, `throw` in TypeScript)
- Returns the API response from Telegram (implicit return of `bot.api.set_webhook(params)` result)

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `setWebhook` method with proper TypeScript signature:
  - Parameters: `url: string` (required), `secretToken?: string` (optional)
  - Return type: `Promise<TelegramApiResponse | undefined>` (returns `undefined` on early return when bot token is blank, otherwise returns Telegram API response)
- [ ] Add early return check if bot token is blank (use the validation method from PHASE2-018 - typically a private method like `isBotTokenValid()` or `validateBotToken()` that returns boolean)
  - If bot token is blank/invalid, return `undefined` immediately (matching Rails `return` behavior which returns `nil`)
- [ ] Build params object with `url` parameter
- [ ] Conditionally add `secret_token` to params only if `secretToken` is provided and not empty (check for truthy and non-empty string)
- [ ] Make HTTP request to Telegram Bot API `setWebhook` endpoint using axios:
  - Endpoint URL: `https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/setWebhook`
  - Method: POST
  - Request body: JSON with `url` and optionally `secret_token`
  - Response: Telegram API response object with `ok` boolean and `result` field
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling:
  - Wrap in try-catch block
  - Log errors with descriptive messages (include error message and stack trace)
  - Re-throw exceptions after logging using `throw` (maintains Rails `raise` behavior - allows callers to handle errors)
- [ ] Return the API response from Telegram (not webhook info - that's a separate method)
- [ ] Reference `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` lines 39-51 for exact behavior

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 4. TelegramService Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` lines 39-51) for exact behavior
- The `secret_token` parameter is optional and should only be included in the API request if provided and not empty (Rails uses `.present?` which checks for non-nil and non-blank)
- Error handling should match Rails pattern: log error details with full stack trace, then re-throw the exception
- Method should follow camelCase naming convention (`setWebhook` not `set_webhook`)
- This method sets the webhook URL, but does not return webhook info (that's handled by `getWebhookInfo` method in a separate task)
- The Rails method implicitly returns the result of `bot.api.set_webhook(params)` - TypeScript should explicitly return the axios response
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

- Next: PHASE2-021

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
