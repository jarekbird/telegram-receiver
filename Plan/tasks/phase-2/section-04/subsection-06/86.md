# PHASE2-023: Implement send_voice method

**Section**: 4. TelegramService Conversion
**Subsection**: 4.6
**Task ID**: PHASE2-023

## Description

Convert the `send_voice` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This method sends a voice/audio file to a Telegram chat. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` lines 77-117.

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `sendVoice` method with signature matching `SendVoiceParams` interface
  - Required parameters: `chat_id` (number), `voice_path` (string - local file path)
  - Optional parameters: `reply_to_message_id` (number), `caption` (string)
- [ ] Add early return if `telegram_bot_token` is blank (consistent with other methods)
- [ ] Validate that the voice file exists at `voice_path`
  - Raise/throw error if file does not exist: "Voice file does not exist"
- [ ] Read file content from disk using binary read
  - Use Node.js `fs.readFileSync` or `fs.promises.readFile` with binary encoding
- [ ] Extract filename from `voice_path` using basename
- [ ] Implement MIME type detection based on file extension (case-insensitive):
  - Extract file extension using `path.extname()` and convert to lowercase
  - `.ogg` or `.oga` → `audio/ogg`
  - `.wav` → `audio/wav`
  - Default (including `.mp3`) → `audio/mpeg`
- [ ] Create multipart form data with file upload
  - Use `FormData` or similar library (e.g., `form-data` package)
  - Include file content, MIME type, and filename
  - Field name should be `voice` (as per Telegram Bot API)
- [ ] Build request parameters:
  - Required: `chat_id`, `voice` (file)
  - Optional: `reply_to_message_id` (if provided), `caption` (if provided)
- [ ] Call Telegram Bot API `sendVoice` endpoint
  - Use POST request with multipart/form-data content type
  - Endpoint: `https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/sendVoice`
- [ ] Return Telegram API response (should match `TelegramApiResponse` type)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling:
  - Catch and log errors with descriptive messages
  - Log error stack trace
  - Re-throw errors after logging
  - Error message format: "Error sending Telegram voice: {error message}"

## Implementation Details

Based on Rails implementation analysis (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` lines 77-117):

1. **Method Signature**: The method accepts `chat_id`, `voice_path`, `reply_to_message_id` (optional), and `caption` (optional). This matches the `SendVoiceParams` interface defined in PHASE2-001.

2. **File Handling**: The Rails implementation:
   - Validates file existence before attempting to read
   - Reads file content using `File.binread` (binary read)
   - Extracts filename using `File.basename`
   - Determines MIME type from file extension

3. **MIME Type Detection**: The Rails code uses a case statement on file extension with case-insensitive matching:
   - Extracts extension using `File.extname(voice_path).downcase` (converts to lowercase)
   - `.ogg` and `.oga` → `audio/ogg`
   - `.wav` → `audio/wav`
   - All other extensions (including `.mp3`) → `audio/mpeg`

4. **Multipart Upload**: Rails uses `Faraday::UploadIO` with `StringIO` to create the upload object. In Node.js, use `FormData` with a file stream or buffer.

5. **Error Handling**: The Rails implementation:
   - Catches `StandardError`
   - Logs error message and full backtrace
   - Re-raises the error after logging

6. **Return Value**: The method returns the Telegram API response (Hash/object).

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 4. TelegramService Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` lines 77-117 for exact behavior
- The `SendVoiceParams` interface is defined in PHASE2-001
- Use the `form-data` npm package or Node.js built-in `FormData` (Node.js 18+) for multipart uploads
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
