# PHASE2-065: Create CursorRunnerCallbackController class structure

**Section**: 9. CursorRunnerCallbackController Conversion
**Subsection**: 9.1
**Task ID**: PHASE2-065

## Description

Create the CursorRunnerCallbackController class structure for handling webhook callbacks from cursor-runner. This controller receives POST requests at `/cursor-runner/callback` when cursor-runner completes an iterate operation. It processes the callback results, retrieves pending request data from Redis, and sends formatted responses back to Telegram.

Reference the Rails implementation in `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` for the complete behavior and functionality.

**Rails Controller Overview:**

- Handles POST `/cursor-runner/callback` endpoint
- Authenticates webhook requests using X-Webhook-Secret header
- Processes callback results from cursor-runner
- Retrieves pending request data from Redis via CursorRunnerCallbackService
- Formats and sends responses to Telegram via TelegramService
- Supports audio responses via ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService
- Handles error cases and sends error notifications

**Key Dependencies:**

- CursorRunnerCallbackService (for Redis state management)
- TelegramService (for sending messages to Telegram)
- ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService (for audio responses)
- SystemSetting model (for checking debug mode and audio output settings)

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/controllers/cursor-runner-callback-controller.ts` file
- [ ] Define CursorRunnerCallbackController class
- [ ] Import Express types (Request, Response, NextFunction)
- [ ] Import required services:
  - [ ] CursorRunnerCallbackService
  - [ ] TelegramService
  - [ ] ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService
- [ ] Import SystemSetting model (for checking debug mode and audio output settings)
- [ ] Add `create` method (POST handler) with basic structure:
  - [ ] Extract and normalize request_id from parameters (handles both camelCase and snake_case)
  - [ ] Validate request_id is present (return 400 if missing)
  - [ ] Retrieve pending request data from Redis via CursorRunnerCallbackService
  - [ ] Handle case where pending_data is nil (return 200 OK with message)
  - [ ] Call processCallback with request_id, result, and pending_data
  - [ ] Always return 200 OK (even on errors) to prevent cursor-runner retries
  - [ ] Wrap in try-catch to handle exceptions gracefully
- [ ] Add `authenticateWebhook` middleware method (checks X-Webhook-Secret header, X-Cursor-Runner-Secret header, or secret query parameter)
- [ ] Add placeholder private methods (will be implemented in later tasks):
  - [ ] `processCallback` - processes callback result and pending data
  - [ ] `sendErrorNotification` - sends error messages to Telegram
  - [ ] `normalizeResult` - normalizes callback result (handles camelCase/snake_case)
  - [ ] `sendResponseToTelegram` - formats and sends response to Telegram
  - [ ] `sendTextAsAudio` - converts text to speech and sends as voice message
  - [ ] `cursorDebugEnabled` - checks if debug mode is enabled
  - [ ] `formatSuccessMessage` - formats success response message
  - [ ] `formatErrorMessage` - formats error response message
  - [ ] `formatMetadata` - formats metadata (iterations, duration)
  - [ ] `formatOutput` - formats output with truncation and code blocks
  - [ ] `formatWarnings` - formats warning messages
  - [ ] `sendErrorFallbackMessage` - sends fallback error message
  - [ ] `cleanAnsiEscapeSequences` - removes ANSI escape codes from text
- [ ] Add error handling structure
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for callback result and pending data

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 9. CursorRunnerCallbackController Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation in `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` for complete behavior

**Rails Implementation Details:**

- Route: `POST /cursor-runner/callback` (defined in `jarek-va/config/routes.rb`)
- Authentication: Uses `before_action :authenticate_webhook` which checks:
  - `X-Webhook-Secret` or `X-Cursor-Runner-Secret` header
  - `secret` query parameter
  - Compares against `Rails.application.config.webhook_secret`
  - Allows requests if secret matches or if secret is not configured (development mode)
- Main `create` action:
  - Accepts callback parameters: success, requestId/request_id, repository, branchName/branch_name, iterations, maxIterations/max_iterations, output, error, exitCode/exit_code, duration, timestamp
  - Normalizes request_id (handles both camelCase and snake_case)
  - Retrieves pending request data from Redis via CursorRunnerCallbackService
  - Processes callback synchronously
  - Always returns 200 OK (even on errors) to prevent cursor-runner retries
- Error handling: Catches exceptions, logs errors, attempts to send error notifications to Telegram, but always returns 200 OK

**TypeScript/Node.js Considerations:**

- Use Express Request/Response types
- Implement authentication as Express middleware
- Handle both camelCase and snake_case parameter names (cursor-runner may send either)
- Use async/await for service calls
- Properly type callback result and pending data structures
- This task creates the structure only - implementation details will be added in subsequent tasks

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Related Tasks

- Previous: PHASE2-064
- Next: PHASE2-066

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
