# PHASE2-075: Add error handling to CallbackController

**Section**: 9. CursorRunnerCallbackController Conversion
**Subsection**: 9.11
**Task ID**: PHASE2-075

## Description

Add comprehensive error handling to CallbackController methods to match the Rails implementation. This task ensures all methods have proper try-catch blocks, error logging, user notifications, and graceful error recovery.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb`

## Checklist

### Main `create` method error handling:

- [ ] Wrap entire method body in try-catch block
- [ ] Catch all errors (catch (error) or catch (e))
- [ ] Log errors with message and stack trace (first 5 lines of stack trace)
- [ ] Call `sendErrorNotification` helper if `pendingData` exists
- [ ] Always return 200 OK status with JSON response `{ received: true, error: 'Internal error' }` to prevent cursor-runner retries
- [ ] Ensure error handling doesn't prevent successful responses

### `processCallback` method error handling:

- [ ] Wrap entire method body in try-catch block
- [ ] Catch all errors
- [ ] Log errors with message and full stack trace (first 10 lines)
- [ ] Extract `chatId` and `messageId` from `pendingData` in error handler
- [ ] Send error message to user via `TelegramService.sendMessage` if `chatId` is present
- [ ] Wrap TelegramService call in nested try-catch to handle send errors
- [ ] Log errors from nested TelegramService calls

### `sendResponseToTelegram` method error handling:

- [ ] Wrap entire method body in try-catch block
- [ ] Catch all errors
- [ ] Log errors with message and full stack trace (all lines)
- [ ] Call `sendErrorFallbackMessage` helper method as fallback
- [ ] Ensure fallback message sending doesn't throw (should be safe)

### `sendTextAsAudio` method error handling:

- [ ] Wrap audio generation and sending in try-catch block
- [ ] Catch all errors
- [ ] Log errors with message and full stack trace
- [ ] Fallback to `TelegramService.sendMessage` with Markdown parse_mode on error
- [ ] Ensure cleanup (file deletion) happens in finally block
- [ ] Handle cleanup errors gracefully (log warnings, don't throw)

### `sendErrorNotification` helper method:

- [ ] Wrap TelegramService call in try-catch block
- [ ] Catch all errors
- [ ] Log errors (don't throw, this is an error handler itself)

### `sendErrorFallbackMessage` helper method:

- [ ] Wrap TelegramService call in try-catch block
- [ ] Catch all errors
- [ ] Log errors (don't throw, this is a fallback error handler)

### Error handling patterns:

- [ ] All error logs should include error message
- [ ] Stack traces should be logged (truncated appropriately: 5 lines for main handler, 10 for processCallback, full for others)
- [ ] User-facing error messages should be user-friendly (e.g., "❌ Error processing cursor command result: {error message}")
- [ ] All TelegramService calls in error handlers should have nested error handling
- [ ] Never throw errors from error handlers (they should be safe fallbacks)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 9. CursorRunnerCallbackController Conversion
- **Rails Implementation Details**:
  - Main `create` method (lines 10-53): Has rescue block catching `StandardError`, logs first 5 lines of backtrace, calls `send_error_notification` if pending_data exists, always returns 200 OK
  - `process_callback` method (lines 93-139): Has rescue block catching `StandardError`, logs first 10 lines of backtrace, sends error message to user if chat_id present, has nested error handling for TelegramService calls
  - `send_response_to_telegram` method (lines 170-218): Has rescue block catching `StandardError`, logs full backtrace, calls `send_error_fallback_message` helper
  - `send_text_as_audio` method (lines 221-255): Has rescue block catching `StandardError`, logs full backtrace, falls back to text message, has ensure block for cleanup
  - `send_error_notification` method (lines 57-70): Has rescue block catching `StandardError`, logs errors
  - `send_error_fallback_message` method (lines 309-317): Has rescue block catching `StandardError`, logs errors
  - All error handlers use `Rails.logger.error` for logging
  - Error messages to users use format: "❌ Error processing cursor command result: {error.message}"
  - All TelegramService calls in error handlers have nested rescue blocks
- **TypeScript Conversion Notes**:
  - Use try-catch blocks instead of rescue blocks
  - Use appropriate logging library (e.g., winston, pino) instead of Rails.logger
  - Stack traces can be accessed via `error.stack` property
  - Ensure all async methods properly handle errors in promise chains or async/await
  - Error handlers should never throw errors themselves (they are fallbacks)
  - Always return 200 OK to cursor-runner to prevent retries (even on errors)

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent (after CallbackController methods are implemented in previous tasks)

## Related Tasks

- Next: PHASE2-076

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
