# PHASE2-076: Write CallbackController integration tests

**Section**: 9. CursorRunnerCallbackController Conversion
**Subsection**: 9.12
**Task ID**: PHASE2-076

## Description

Write comprehensive integration tests for the CursorRunnerCallbackController to match the Rails test suite. These tests should verify the callback endpoint handles all scenarios including authentication, success/failure cases, error handling, parsing fallbacks, and edge cases.

**Rails Reference**:

- `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` (implementation)
- `jarek-va/spec/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller_spec.rb` (test suite)

## Checklist

### Test File Setup:

- [ ] Create `tests/integration/api/cursor-runner-callback-controller.test.ts`
- [ ] Use Supertest for HTTP endpoint testing
- [ ] Set up proper test fixtures and mocks
- [ ] Mock TelegramService (all methods: sendMessage, sendVoice)
- [ ] Mock CallbackService (getPendingRequest, removePendingRequest)
- [ ] Mock ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService (synthesize method)
- [ ] Mock SystemSetting (enabled? and disabled? methods)
- [ ] Set up webhook secret configuration for tests

### Authentication Tests:

- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback without authentication returns 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback with X-Webhook-Secret header authenticates successfully
- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback with X-Cursor-Runner-Secret header authenticates successfully
- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback with secret in query parameter authenticates successfully
- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback with invalid secret returns 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback without secret when webhook_secret is not configured (development mode) accepts request

### Valid Callback Result Tests (Success):

- [ ] Test successful callback with valid request_id retrieves pending request from CallbackService
- [ ] Test successful callback sends response to Telegram via TelegramService
- [ ] Test successful callback cleans up pending request (calls removePendingRequest)
- [ ] Test successful callback returns 200 OK with JSON response `{ received: true, request_id: ... }`
- [ ] Test with CURSOR_DEBUG disabled (default) sends only raw output to Telegram (no metadata)
- [ ] Test with CURSOR_DEBUG enabled sends formatted response with metadata (✅ Cursor command completed successfully, 📊 Iterations, ⏱ Duration)
- [ ] Test with CURSOR_DEBUG enabled uses HTML code blocks for output formatting (`<pre><code>...</code></pre>`)

### Valid Callback Result Tests (Failure):

- [ ] Test failed callback (success: false) with CURSOR_DEBUG disabled sends simple error message (❌ {error})
- [ ] Test failed callback (success: false) with CURSOR_DEBUG enabled sends detailed error message (❌ Cursor command failed\n\nError: {error})
- [ ] Test failed callback still cleans up pending request

### Edge Cases:

- [ ] Test callback with missing request_id returns 400 Bad Request with error message
- [ ] Test callback with unknown request_id (not in Redis) returns 200 OK but logs warning
- [ ] Test callback with unknown request_id returns JSON `{ received: true, message: 'Request not found' }`
- [ ] Test callback with ANSI escape sequences in output removes them before sending to Telegram
- [ ] Test callback with long output (>4000 chars without debug, >3500 with debug) truncates output and appends "..."
- [ ] Test callback with long output and CURSOR_DEBUG enabled includes "truncated" in message and uses HTML code blocks

### Parse Mode Fallback Tests:

- [ ] Test when Markdown parsing fails, falls back to HTML parse_mode
- [ ] Test when Markdown parsing fails, logs warning about Markdown failure
- [ ] Test when both Markdown and HTML parsing fail, falls back to plain text (no parse_mode)
- [ ] Test when both Markdown and HTML parsing fail, logs warnings about both failures
- [ ] Test parse mode fallback still sends message successfully

### Error Handling Tests:

- [ ] Test when processCallback raises an error, returns 200 OK (to prevent cursor-runner retries)
- [ ] Test when processCallback raises an error, logs the error
- [ ] Test when processCallback raises an error, sends error message to user via TelegramService
- [ ] Test error message format: "❌ Error processing cursor command result: {error.message}"
- [ ] Test error message uses HTML parse_mode
- [ ] Test when sending error notification fails, logs error but doesn't throw

### Audio Output Tests (if original_was_audio flag):

- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true and allow_audio_output is enabled, sends response as voice message
- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true, calls ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService.synthesize
- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true, calls TelegramService.sendVoice with audio file
- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true and audio generation fails, falls back to text message
- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true, cleans up generated audio file after sending
- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true but allow_audio_output is disabled, sends text message instead
- [ ] Test audio cleanup errors are logged but don't throw

### Result Normalization Tests:

- [ ] Test callback handles both camelCase (requestId, branchName, maxIterations, exitCode) and snake_case (request_id, branch_name, max_iterations, exit_code) parameter formats
- [ ] Test success boolean normalization (handles string "true"/"false", number 1/0, boolean true/false)
- [ ] Test default values (max_iterations defaults to 25, exit_code defaults to 0, iterations defaults to 0)

### Integration Test Structure:

- [ ] Use describe blocks to organize tests by scenario (authentication, success cases, failure cases, edge cases, etc.)
- [ ] Use beforeEach/afterEach for test setup and cleanup
- [ ] Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
- [ ] Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what is being tested
- [ ] Verify all mocked services are called with correct parameters
- [ ] Test both happy paths and error scenarios

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 9. CursorRunnerCallbackController Conversion
- **Rails Test Reference**: The Rails spec file (`cursor_runner_callback_controller_spec.rb`) contains comprehensive tests covering all scenarios. Use it as a reference for test structure and coverage.
- **Test Location**: Integration tests should be placed in `tests/integration/api/` directory, not `tests/controllers/`
- **Testing Framework**: Use Jest with Supertest for HTTP endpoint testing
- **Mocking**: All external services (TelegramService, CallbackService, ElevenLabs services, SystemSetting) should be mocked
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 100% coverage of the callback controller's main code paths
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - Authentication with various methods (header, query param, no secret in dev)
  - Success and failure callback processing
  - CURSOR_DEBUG enabled/disabled behavior differences
  - Parse mode fallbacks (Markdown → HTML → plain text)
  - Error handling and user notifications
  - Edge cases (missing request_id, unknown request_id, long output, ANSI sequences)
  - Audio output when original_was_audio flag is set
  - Result normalization (camelCase vs snake_case, boolean handling)
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent (after CallbackController implementation is complete)

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
