# PHASE2-076: Write CallbackController integration tests

**Section**: 9. CursorRunnerCallbackController Conversion
**Subsection**: 9.12
**Task ID**: PHASE2-076

## Description

Write comprehensive integration tests for the CursorRunnerCallbackController to match the Rails test suite. These tests should verify the callback endpoint handles all scenarios including authentication, success/failure cases, error handling, parsing fallbacks, and edge cases.

**Rails Reference**:

- `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` (implementation)
- `jarek-va/spec/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller_spec.rb` (test suite)

## Checklist

### Test File Setup:

- [ ] Create `tests/integration/api/cursor-runner-callback-controller.test.ts`
- [ ] Use Supertest for HTTP endpoint testing
- [ ] Set up proper test fixtures and mocks
- [ ] Mock TelegramService (all methods: sendMessage, sendVoice)
- [ ] Mock CallbackService (getPendingRequest, removePendingRequest)
- [ ] Mock ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService (synthesize method)
- [ ] Mock SystemSetting (enabled? and disabled? methods)
- [ ] Set up webhook secret configuration for tests

### Authentication Tests:

- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback without authentication returns 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback with X-Webhook-Secret header authenticates successfully
- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback with X-Cursor-Runner-Secret header authenticates successfully
- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback with secret in query parameter authenticates successfully
- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback with invalid secret returns 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] Test POST /cursor-runner/callback without secret when webhook_secret is not configured (development mode) accepts request

### Valid Callback Result Tests (Success):

- [ ] Test successful callback with valid request_id retrieves pending request from CallbackService
- [ ] Test successful callback sends response to Telegram via TelegramService
- [ ] Test successful callback cleans up pending request (calls removePendingRequest)
- [ ] Test successful callback returns 200 OK with JSON response `{ received: true, request_id: ... }`
- [ ] Test with CURSOR_DEBUG disabled (default) sends only raw output to Telegram (no metadata)
- [ ] Test with CURSOR_DEBUG enabled sends formatted response with metadata (✅ Cursor command completed successfully, 📊 Iterations, ⏱ Duration)
- [ ] Test with CURSOR_DEBUG enabled uses HTML code blocks for output formatting (`<pre><code>...</code></pre>`)

### Valid Callback Result Tests (Failure):

- [ ] Test failed callback (success: false) with CURSOR_DEBUG disabled sends simple error message (❌ {error})
- [ ] Test failed callback (success: false) with CURSOR_DEBUG enabled sends detailed error message (❌ Cursor command failed\n\nError: {error})
- [ ] Test failed callback still cleans up pending request

### Edge Cases:

- [ ] Test callback with missing request_id returns 400 Bad Request with error message
- [ ] Test callback with unknown request_id (not in Redis) returns 200 OK but logs warning
- [ ] Test callback with unknown request_id returns JSON `{ received: true, message: 'Request not found' }`
- [ ] Test callback with ANSI escape sequences in output removes them before sending to Telegram
- [ ] Test callback with long output (>4000 chars without debug, >3500 with debug) truncates output and appends "..."
- [ ] Test callback with long output and CURSOR_DEBUG enabled includes "truncated" in message and uses HTML code blocks

### Parse Mode Fallback Tests:

- [ ] Test when Markdown parsing fails, falls back to HTML parse_mode
- [ ] Test when Markdown parsing fails, logs warning about Markdown failure
- [ ] Test when both Markdown and HTML parsing fail, falls back to plain text (no parse_mode)
- [ ] Test when both Markdown and HTML parsing fail, logs warnings about both failures
- [ ] Test parse mode fallback still sends message successfully

### Error Handling Tests:

- [ ] Test when processCallback raises an error, returns 200 OK (to prevent cursor-runner retries)
- [ ] Test when processCallback raises an error, logs the error
- [ ] Test when processCallback raises an error, sends error message to user via TelegramService
- [ ] Test error message format: "❌ Error processing cursor command result: {error.message}"
- [ ] Test error message uses HTML parse_mode
- [ ] Test when sending error notification fails, logs error but doesn't throw

### Audio Output Tests (if original_was_audio flag):

- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true and allow_audio_output is enabled, sends response as voice message
- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true, calls ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService.synthesize
- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true, calls TelegramService.sendVoice with audio file
- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true and audio generation fails, falls back to text message
- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true, cleans up generated audio file after sending
- [ ] Test when original_was_audio is true but allow_audio_output is disabled, sends text message instead
- [ ] Test audio cleanup errors are logged but don't throw

### Result Normalization Tests:

- [ ] Test callback handles both camelCase (requestId, branchName, maxIterations, exitCode) and snake_case (request_id, branch_name, max_iterations, exit_code) parameter formats
- [ ] Test success boolean normalization (handles string "true"/"false", number 1/0, boolean true/false)
- [ ] Test default values (max_iterations defaults to 25, exit_code defaults to 0, iterations defaults to 0)

### Integration Test Structure:

- [ ] Use describe blocks to organize tests by scenario (authentication, success cases, failure cases, edge cases, etc.)
- [ ] Use beforeEach/afterEach for test setup and cleanup
- [ ] Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
- [ ] Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what is being tested
- [ ] Verify all mocked services are called with correct parameters
- [ ] Test both happy paths and error scenarios

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 9. CursorRunnerCallbackController Conversion
- **Rails Test Reference**: The Rails spec file (`cursor_runner_callback_controller_spec.rb`) contains comprehensive tests covering all scenarios. Use it as a reference for test structure and coverage.
- **Test Location**: Integration tests should be placed in `tests/integration/api/` directory, not `tests/controllers/`
- **Testing Framework**: Use Jest with Supertest for HTTP endpoint testing
- **Mocking**: All external services (TelegramService, CallbackService, ElevenLabs services, SystemSetting) should be mocked
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for 100% coverage of the callback controller's main code paths
- **Key Test Scenarios**:
  - Authentication with various methods (header, query param, no secret in dev)
  - Success and failure callback processing
  - CURSOR_DEBUG enabled/disabled behavior differences
  - Parse mode fallbacks (Markdown → HTML → plain text)
  - Error handling and user notifications
  - Edge cases (missing request_id, unknown request_id, long output, ANSI sequences)
  - Audio output when original_was_audio flag is set
  - Result normalization (camelCase vs snake_case, boolean handling)
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent (after CallbackController implementation is complete)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
