# PHASE2-069: Implement normalize_result utility

**Section**: 9. CursorRunnerCallbackController Conversion
**Subsection**: 9.5
**Task ID**: PHASE2-069

## Description

Convert and implement the `normalize_result` utility function from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This utility normalizes cursor-runner callback result objects by handling both camelCase and snake_case keys, converting success values to booleans, and extracting all result fields with appropriate defaults.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` (lines 142-167)

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `normalizeResult` utility function in `src/utils/normalize-result.ts`
- [ ] Handle both camelCase and snake_case string keys for all fields that have variants (e.g., `requestId`/`request_id`, `branchName`/`branch_name`, `maxIterations`/`max_iterations`, `exitCode`/`exit_code`)
  - Note: In TypeScript/JavaScript, input will be plain objects with string keys (not symbol keys like Ruby). The Rails implementation handles symbol keys (`:success`) and string keys (`'success'`) because Rails params can come in either format, but in TypeScript we only need to handle string keys in both camelCase and snake_case formats.
- [ ] Convert `success` field to boolean:
  - Handle `true`, `'true'`, `1`, `'1'` as `true`
  - Handle `false`, `'false'`, `0`, `'0'`, `null`/`undefined` as `false`
- [ ] Extract and normalize all result fields:
  - `success` (boolean, required)
  - `request_id` (from `requestId` or `request_id`, required)
  - `repository` (optional)
  - `branch_name` (from `branchName` or `branch_name`, optional)
  - `iterations` (defaults to `0` if not provided)
  - `max_iterations` (from `maxIterations` or `max_iterations`, defaults to `25` if not provided)
  - `output` (defaults to empty string `''` if not provided)
  - `error` (optional)
  - `exit_code` (from `exitCode` or `exit_code`, defaults to `0` if not provided)
  - `duration` (optional)
  - `timestamp` (optional)
- [ ] Return normalized object with snake_case keys (TypeScript naming convention)
- [ ] Export function for use in CursorRunnerCallbackController

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 9. CursorRunnerCallbackController Conversion
- **Rails Implementation**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` (lines 142-167)
- The utility is used in the `process_callback` method (line 99) to normalize callback results before processing
- The Rails implementation handles both symbol keys (`:success`) and string keys (`'success'`) because Rails params can come in either format. In TypeScript/JavaScript, we only need to handle string keys in both camelCase and snake_case formats, as JavaScript objects use string keys by default.
- Default values match the Rails implementation:
  - `iterations`: `0`
  - `max_iterations`: `25`
  - `output`: `''` (empty string)
  - `exit_code`: `0`
- The boolean conversion for `success` is critical because params may send string `"false"` which is truthy in JavaScript, so explicit conversion is needed
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
