# PHASE2-099: Test middleware functionality

**Section**: 12. Middleware
**Subsection**: 12.5
**Task ID**: PHASE2-099

## Description

Create comprehensive tests for middleware authentication functionality, converting test coverage from Rails RSpec tests to TypeScript/Node.js Jest tests. This task ensures all authentication middleware (webhook auth, admin auth, cursor-runner callback auth, and agent tools auth) are properly tested.

**Rails Test Implementation References**:

- `jarek-va/spec/controllers/telegram_controller_spec.rb` (lines 30-50, 247-391): Telegram webhook and admin authentication tests
- `jarek-va/spec/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller_spec.rb` (lines 36-379): Cursor-runner callback authentication tests
- `jarek-va/spec/controllers/agent_tools_controller_spec.rb` (lines 13-63): Agent tools authentication tests

**Rails Implementation Details**:

1. **Telegram Webhook Authentication Tests** (`telegram_controller_spec.rb`):
   - Without authentication when webhook secret is configured → returns 401 Unauthorized
   - Without authentication when webhook secret is NOT configured (blank/empty) → accepts request (200 OK)
   - With valid `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header → accepts request (200 OK)
   - Note: Rails tests don't explicitly test invalid secret (only missing vs valid), but testing invalid secret ensures robustness

2. **Admin Authentication Tests** (`telegram_controller_spec.rb`):
   - Without admin authentication → returns 401 Unauthorized (for all admin routes: set_webhook, webhook_info, delete_webhook)
   - With valid `X-Admin-Secret` header → accepts request (200 OK)
   - Admin routes tested: `POST /telegram/set_webhook`, `GET /telegram/webhook_info`, `DELETE /telegram/webhook`
   - Note: Rails tests only explicitly test header authentication, but Rails code supports query/body params (checked via `params[:admin_secret]` or `params['admin_secret']`). Testing query/body params ensures complete coverage of supported functionality.

3. **Cursor-Runner Callback Authentication Tests** (`cursor_runner_callback_controller_spec.rb`):
   - Without authentication → returns 401 Unauthorized
   - With valid `X-Webhook-Secret` header → accepts request (200 OK)
   - With valid `secret` query parameter → accepts request (200 OK) (explicitly tested in Rails)
   - When webhook secret is not configured (blank/empty) → accepts request without secret (200 OK) - development mode
   - Note: Rails code supports `X-Cursor-Runner-Secret` header (checked via `request.headers['X-Cursor-Runner-Secret']`), but Rails tests don't explicitly test it. Testing this header ensures complete coverage of supported functionality.

4. **Agent Tools Authentication Tests** (`agent_tools_controller_spec.rb`):
   - Without authentication → returns 401 Unauthorized
   - With valid `X-EL-Secret` header → accepts request (200 OK)
   - Note: Rails code supports `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` header (checked via `request.headers['Authorization']&.gsub(/^Bearer /, '')`), but Rails tests don't explicitly test it. Testing this header ensures complete coverage of supported functionality.

**Prerequisites**:

- PHASE2-096: Create webhook authentication middleware (must exist: `src/middleware/telegram-webhook-auth.middleware.ts`)
- PHASE2-097: Create admin authentication middleware (must exist: `src/middleware/admin-auth.ts`)
- PHASE2-098: Apply middleware to routes (middleware must be applied to routes)
- Cursor-runner webhook auth middleware (must exist: `src/middleware/cursor-runner-webhook-auth.middleware.ts`)
- Agent tools auth middleware (must exist: `src/middleware/agent-tools-auth.middleware.ts` - may need to be created if not already done)

## Implementation Notes

- Use Jest testing framework (standard for TypeScript/Node.js projects)
- Mock Express `req`, `res`, and `next` objects for unit tests
- Use `supertest` for integration tests with actual Express routes
- Test environment variables should be set in test setup:
  - `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for telegram webhook auth tests
  - `WEBHOOK_SECRET` for admin auth, cursor-runner callback auth, and agent tools auth tests (all use the same `webhook_secret` config value in Rails)
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Test edge cases: missing secrets, blank secrets, invalid secrets, multiple secret sources
- Verify middleware calls `next()` on success and returns error response on failure
- Ensure tests match Rails test behavior exactly

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 12. Middleware
- Subsection: 12.5
- Reference the Rails test implementation for exact test cases and behavior
- Tests should cover all authentication scenarios from Rails RSpec tests
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Related Tasks

- Previous: PHASE2-098
- Next: PHASE2-100

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
