# PHASE2-096: Create webhook authentication middleware

**Section**: 12. Middleware
**Subsection**: 12.2
**Task ID**: PHASE2-096

## Description

Convert create webhook authentication middleware from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This middleware authenticates incoming Telegram webhook requests by validating the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header against a configured secret.

**Rails Implementation Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb` (lines 134-143)

**Rails Implementation Details**:

- The `authenticate_webhook` method is a private method in `TelegramController`
- It's used as a `before_action` filter (line 9) that only applies to the `webhook` action
- Gets the secret token from the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` request header (may be `nil` if header is missing)
- Gets the expected secret from `Rails.application.config.telegram_webhook_secret`
- Allows the request if:
  - The expected secret is blank/not configured (development mode), OR
  - The provided secret token matches the expected secret (exact string match)
- Returns 401 Unauthorized if the secret is configured but doesn't match (including when header is missing)
- Logs a warning message when authentication fails: "Unauthorized Telegram webhook request - invalid secret token"

**Configuration**:

- The webhook secret is configured via environment variable `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- In Rails, the config value comes from `Rails.application.config.telegram_webhook_secret` which reads from Rails credentials or `ENV.fetch('TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET', 'changeme')`
- **Important**: The Rails implementation uses `.blank?` check, which returns `true` for empty string, `nil`, or whitespace-only strings
- If the expected secret is blank (empty string, nil, or whitespace), requests are allowed (development mode / backward compatibility)
- If the expected secret is configured (non-blank), the header token must match exactly
- In TypeScript/Node.js, check if the environment variable is undefined, null, or empty string to determine if secret is "blank"

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/middleware/telegram-webhook-auth.middleware.ts` (matching naming from PHASE2-095)
- [ ] Implement Express middleware function following the pattern: `(req, res, next) => { ... }`
- [ ] Extract `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header from request
- [ ] Get expected secret from application configuration (environment variable `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
- [ ] Implement authentication logic:
  - [ ] Allow request if expected secret is blank/not configured (development mode) - call `next()`
  - [ ] Allow request if provided token matches expected secret - call `next()`
  - [ ] Return 401 Unauthorized if secret is configured but doesn't match - do NOT call `next()`
- [ ] Log warning message when authentication fails: "Unauthorized Telegram webhook request - invalid secret token"
- [ ] Ensure middleware calls `next()` to continue request processing when authentication succeeds
- [ ] Ensure middleware returns 401 response and does not call `next()` when authentication fails

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 12. Middleware
- Reference the Rails implementation in `jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb` for exact behavior
- The middleware should be applied only to the webhook endpoint, similar to how Rails uses `before_action :authenticate_webhook, only: [:webhook]`
- In Express, this will be a middleware function that can be applied to specific routes
- Test cases should verify:
  - Request is allowed when secret is not configured (blank/empty)
  - Request is allowed when header token matches configured secret
  - Request is rejected (401) when secret is configured but header token doesn't match
  - Request is rejected (401) when secret is configured but header is missing
  - Warning is logged when authentication fails
- File naming should match PHASE2-095: `telegram-webhook-auth.middleware.ts`
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
