# PHASE2-095: Create authentication middleware directory

**Section**: 12. Middleware
**Subsection**: 12.1
**Task ID**: PHASE2-095

## Description

Set up the authentication middleware directory structure and plan the middleware files that will be created to convert Rails `before_action` authentication filters to Express middleware. This task establishes the foundation for converting authentication logic from Rails controllers to reusable Express middleware functions.

## Rails Implementation Reference

The Rails application uses `before_action` filters in controllers for authentication:

1. **TelegramController** (`app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb`):
   - `authenticate_webhook` (private method) - Authenticates Telegram webhook requests
     - Checks `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header
     - Validates against `Rails.application.config.telegram_webhook_secret`
     - Allows requests if secret is blank (development mode)
     - Returns 401 Unauthorized if secret doesn't match
     - Logs warning: "Unauthorized Telegram webhook request - invalid secret token"
   - `authenticate_admin` (protected method) - Authenticates admin endpoints
     - Checks `X-Admin-Secret` header, `HTTP_X_ADMIN_SECRET` env var, or `admin_secret` query param
     - Validates against `Rails.application.config.webhook_secret`
     - Has debug logging in test environment when authentication fails
     - Returns boolean (true if authenticated)

2. **CursorRunnerCallbackController** (`app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb`):
   - `authenticate_webhook` (private method) - Authenticates cursor-runner callback requests
     - Checks `X-Webhook-Secret` or `X-Cursor-Runner-Secret` headers, or `secret` query param
     - Validates against `Rails.application.config.webhook_secret`
     - Allows requests if secret is blank (development mode)
     - Returns 401 Unauthorized with JSON error if secret doesn't match
     - Logs warning with secret status and IP address

3. **AgentToolsController** (`app/controllers/agent_tools_controller.rb`):
   - `authenticate_webhook` (private method) - Authenticates agent tool requests
     - Checks `X-EL-Secret` header or `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
     - Validates against `Rails.application.config.webhook_secret`
     - **Note**: Unlike other controllers, does NOT allow blank secrets in development mode (always requires valid secret)
     - Returns 401 Unauthorized with JSON error if secret doesn't match
     - Logs warning: "Unauthorized tool request - invalid secret"

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify `src/middleware` directory exists (should already exist from Phase 1)
- [ ] Create `src/middleware/README.md` documenting middleware structure and purpose
- [ ] Plan the following middleware files to be created in subsequent tasks:
  - [ ] `src/middleware/telegram-webhook-auth.middleware.ts` - Telegram webhook authentication (PHASE2-096)
  - [ ] `src/middleware/admin-auth.middleware.ts` - Admin endpoint authentication (PHASE2-097)
  - [ ] `src/middleware/cursor-runner-webhook-auth.middleware.ts` - Cursor-runner callback authentication (to be created)
  - [ ] `src/middleware/agent-tools-auth.middleware.ts` - Agent tools authentication (to be created)
- [ ] Document authentication patterns:
  - [ ] Header-based authentication (X-\*-Secret headers)
  - [ ] Query parameter fallbacks (where applicable)
  - [ ] Authorization Bearer token support (for agent tools)
  - [ ] Development mode behavior (allow when secret not configured) - **Note**: AgentToolsController does NOT allow blank secrets, always requires valid secret
  - [ ] Error response formats (401 Unauthorized with JSON)
- [ ] Document configuration requirements:
  - [ ] `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For Telegram webhook authentication
  - [ ] `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For admin, cursor-runner, and agent tools authentication
- [ ] Create `src/middleware/index.ts` barrel export file (empty for now, will export middleware in subsequent tasks)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 12. Middleware
- The `src/middleware` directory should already exist from Phase 1 infrastructure setup
- This task focuses on planning and documentation - actual middleware implementation happens in subsequent tasks
- Rails uses `before_action` filters which are controller-specific; Express middleware is more reusable and can be applied to routes
- Each authentication method in Rails will become a separate Express middleware function
- Middleware should follow Express middleware pattern: `(req, res, next) => { ... }`
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
