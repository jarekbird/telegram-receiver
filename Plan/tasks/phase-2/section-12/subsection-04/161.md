# PHASE2-098: Apply middleware to routes

**Section**: 12. Middleware
**Subsection**: 12.4
**Task ID**: PHASE2-098

## Description

Apply authentication middleware to Express routes to match Rails `before_action` filters. This task integrates the middleware created in PHASE2-096 and PHASE2-097 with the route definitions created in PHASE2-091 and PHASE2-092.

**Rails Implementation Reference**:

- `jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb` (line 9): `before_action :authenticate_webhook, only: [:webhook]`
- `jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb` (lines 52, 74, 92): Admin routes use inline `authenticate_admin` checks
- `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` (line 6): `before_action :authenticate_webhook`

**Rails Implementation Details**:

1. **Telegram Webhook Route** (`POST /telegram/webhook`):
   - Uses `before_action :authenticate_webhook, only: [:webhook]`
   - Only the webhook endpoint requires webhook authentication (not admin routes)

2. **Telegram Admin Routes** (`POST /telegram/set_webhook`, `GET /telegram/webhook_info`, `DELETE /telegram/webhook`):
   - Each route uses inline `authenticate_admin` check (not `before_action`)
   - Should be converted to middleware for consistency and reusability

3. **Cursor-Runner Callback Route** (`POST /cursor-runner/callback`):
   - Uses `before_action :authenticate_webhook` (different implementation than Telegram webhook auth)
   - Checks `X-Webhook-Secret` OR `X-Cursor-Runner-Secret` headers OR `secret` query/body param
   - Compares against `webhook_secret` (not `telegram_webhook_secret`)

**Prerequisites**:

- PHASE2-091: Create telegram routes (must exist: `src/routes/telegram-routes.ts`)
- PHASE2-092: Create cursor-runner callback routes (must exist: `src/routes/cursor-runner-routes.ts`)
- PHASE2-096: Create webhook authentication middleware (must exist: `src/middleware/telegram-webhook-auth.middleware.ts`)
- PHASE2-097: Create admin authentication middleware (must exist: `src/middleware/admin-auth.ts`)
- Cursor-runner webhook auth middleware (may need to be created: `src/middleware/cursor-runner-webhook-auth.middleware.ts` - see checklist item below for creation instructions if it doesn't exist)

## Checklist

- [ ] Open `src/routes/telegram-routes.ts` (created in PHASE2-091)
- [ ] Import telegram webhook auth middleware from `../middleware/telegram-webhook-auth.middleware`
- [ ] Import admin auth middleware from `../middleware/admin-auth`
- [ ] Apply telegram webhook auth middleware to POST `/telegram/webhook` route
  - Middleware should be applied before the controller handler
  - Route path: `POST /webhook` (mounted under `/telegram` prefix)
- [ ] Apply admin auth middleware to POST `/telegram/set_webhook` route
  - Route path: `POST /set_webhook` (mounted under `/telegram` prefix)
- [ ] Apply admin auth middleware to GET `/telegram/webhook_info` route
  - Route path: `GET /webhook_info` (mounted under `/telegram` prefix)
- [ ] Apply admin auth middleware to DELETE `/telegram/webhook` route
  - Route path: `DELETE /webhook` (mounted under `/telegram` prefix)
- [ ] Open `src/routes/cursor-runner-routes.ts` (created in PHASE2-092)
- [ ] Import cursor-runner webhook auth middleware from `../middleware/cursor-runner-webhook-auth.middleware` (create the middleware file if it doesn't exist)
  - **If middleware doesn't exist**, create `src/middleware/cursor-runner-webhook-auth.middleware.ts` based on `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` (lines 72-91)
  - Should check `X-Webhook-Secret` OR `X-Cursor-Runner-Secret` headers OR `secret` query/body param (in that order of precedence)
  - Should compare against `process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET` (not `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
  - Should allow requests when secret is blank (development mode)
  - Should return 401 Unauthorized with JSON error response when authentication fails
- [ ] Apply cursor-runner webhook auth middleware to POST `/cursor-runner/callback` route
  - Middleware should be applied before the controller handler
  - Route path: `POST /callback` (mounted under `/cursor-runner` prefix)
- [ ] Verify middleware order: authentication middleware should be applied before controller handlers
- [ ] Test middleware application:
  - [ ] Test telegram webhook route rejects requests without valid `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header
  - [ ] Test telegram webhook route accepts requests with valid `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header
  - [ ] Test telegram admin routes reject requests without valid `X-Admin-Secret` header
  - [ ] Test telegram admin routes accept requests with valid `X-Admin-Secret` header
  - [ ] Test cursor-runner callback route rejects requests without valid webhook secret
  - [ ] Test cursor-runner callback route accepts requests with valid `X-Webhook-Secret` or `X-Cursor-Runner-Secret` header or `secret` query/body param

## Implementation Notes

- Express middleware should be applied using the pattern: `router.post('/path', middleware, handler)`
- Middleware functions should call `next()` when authentication succeeds
- Middleware functions should return 401 response and NOT call `next()` when authentication fails
- The telegram webhook auth middleware (from PHASE2-096) checks `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header
- The admin auth middleware (from PHASE2-097) checks `X-Admin-Secret` header or `admin_secret` query/body param (checks header first, then params)
- The cursor-runner webhook auth middleware checks `X-Webhook-Secret` OR `X-Cursor-Runner-Secret` headers OR `secret` query/body param
- All middleware should allow requests when the expected secret is not configured (development mode)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 12. Middleware
- Subsection: 12.4
- Reference the Rails implementation in `jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb` and `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` for exact behavior
- This task assumes route files and middleware files have been created in previous tasks
- If cursor-runner webhook auth middleware doesn't exist, it should be created as part of this task (or referenced if it exists)
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Related Tasks

- Next: PHASE2-099

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
