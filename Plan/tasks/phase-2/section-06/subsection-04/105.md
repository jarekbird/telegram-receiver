# PHASE2-042: Implement remove_pending_request method

**Section**: 6. CursorRunnerCallbackService Conversion
**Subsection**: 6.4
**Task ID**: PHASE2-042

## Description

Implement the `removePendingRequest` method in the CursorRunnerCallbackService class. This method removes pending cursor-runner request information from Redis after processing a callback. It takes a unique request ID, generates the Redis key, and deletes the key from Redis.

Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb` (lines 51-57) for complete behavior details.

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `removePendingRequest(requestId: string)` method
  - Method signature: `requestId` (required string)
  - Return type: `void` (method doesn't return a value)
- [ ] Use private `redisKey(requestId: string)` helper method to generate Redis key with prefix
  - The helper method prepends `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX` constant (`'cursor_runner_callback:'`) to the request ID
- [ ] Delete key from Redis using `ioredis` package (project standard from PHASE2-039)
  - Use `redis.del(key)` method with the generated Redis key
  - Note: `del()` returns a number (count of keys deleted: 0 if key didn't exist, 1 if deleted)
  - The Rails implementation doesn't check the return value, so TypeScript implementation can also ignore it
- [ ] Add error handling for Redis operations
  - Handle Redis connection errors
  - Handle Redis operation errors
  - Log errors using `console.error()` (matching PHASE2-039 convention)
  - Consider whether to throw errors or handle gracefully (Rails version doesn't have explicit error handling, but TypeScript should add it for robustness)
  - Note: Error handling details will be refined in PHASE2-043
- [ ] Log successful operation with info level
  - Log message should include: request ID
  - Format: `"Removed pending cursor-runner request: {requestId}"`
  - Use `console.log()` for logging (matching PHASE2-039 convention, as no logger utility exists yet in the project)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 6. CursorRunnerCallbackService Conversion
- Subsection: 6.4
- Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb` (lines 51-57) for complete behavior details

**Rails Implementation Details:**

- Method signature: `remove_pending_request(request_id)`
- Uses `redis_key(request_id)` private helper to generate key with `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX` prefix
- Uses `@redis.del(key)` to delete the key from Redis
- Logs: `Rails.logger.info("Removed pending cursor-runner request: #{request_id}")`
- No explicit error handling in Rails version (relies on Redis client exceptions)
- Method is called after processing callback to clean up stored request data

**TypeScript Implementation Requirements:**

- Method name: `removePendingRequest` (camelCase conversion from Ruby snake_case)
- Parameters: `requestId: string`
- Return type: `void` (method doesn't return a value)
- Use the private `redisKey()` helper method that should already exist from PHASE2-039
- Use `ioredis` package (project standard from PHASE2-039) - Redis client's `del()` method
  - Note: `del()` returns a number (count of keys deleted), but the return value can be ignored
- Add proper error handling (try/catch) for Redis operations and log errors using `console.error()`
- Use `console.log()` for info logging (matching PHASE2-039 convention, as no logger utility exists yet in the project)
- Ensure method is added to the `CursorRunnerCallbackService` class created in PHASE2-039

**Dependencies:**

- Assumes `CursorRunnerCallbackService` class structure exists (from PHASE2-039)
- Assumes `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX` constant exists
- Assumes private `redisKey()` helper method exists
- Assumes Redis client instance is available as private property

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
