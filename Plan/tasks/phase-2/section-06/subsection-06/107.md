# PHASE2-044: Write CursorRunnerCallbackService unit tests

**Section**: 6. CursorRunnerCallbackService Conversion
**Subsection**: 6.6
**Task ID**: PHASE2-044

## Description

Write comprehensive unit tests for the CursorRunnerCallbackService class in TypeScript/Node.js. The tests should cover all public methods, error handling, TTL management, and Redis operations. Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb` and the TypeScript implementation created in PHASE2-039 through PHASE2-043.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `tests/unit/services/cursor-runner-callback-service.test.ts` file
- [ ] Import necessary testing utilities and mocks
  - Import `mockRedisClient` and `resetRedisMocks` from `tests/mocks/redis.ts`
  - Import Jest testing utilities (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`)
  - Import the `CursorRunnerCallbackService` class from `src/services/cursor-runner-callback-service.ts`
- [ ] Set up test suite structure
  - Use `describe` blocks to organize tests by method
  - Add `beforeEach` to reset Redis mocks before each test
  - Add `afterEach` to clean up after each test
- [ ] Test constructor initialization
  - Test constructor with provided `redisClient` parameter (should use provided client directly)
  - Test constructor with provided `redisUrl` parameter (should create new Redis client from URL using `new Redis(url)` from ioredis - mock the Redis constructor)
  - Test constructor with neither parameter (should use `REDIS_URL` environment variable if set, otherwise default to `'redis://localhost:6379/0'` - mock the Redis constructor)
  - Test that Redis client is stored as private property
  - Test that constructor prioritizes `redisClient` over `redisUrl` if both are provided (if `redisClient` is provided, `redisUrl` is ignored - matches Rails behavior)
- [ ] Test `storePendingRequest` method
  - Test storing request with default TTL (should use `DEFAULT_TTL` constant = 3600)
  - Test storing request with custom TTL (should use provided TTL value)
  - Test that Redis key is generated correctly with `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX` prefix
  - Test that data is serialized to JSON before storing
  - Test that `redis.setex()` is called with correct parameters (key, ttl, jsonString)
  - Test that info log is written with request ID and TTL
  - Test Redis connection error handling (should throw or handle gracefully)
  - Test Redis operation error handling (should throw or handle gracefully)
  - Test TTL validation (if implemented in PHASE2-043: should validate TTL is positive integer, should validate TTL is within bounds)
- [ ] Test `getPendingRequest` method
  - Test retrieving existing request (should return parsed JSON object with string keys - TypeScript doesn't have symbol keys like Ruby's `symbolize_names: true`)
  - Test retrieving non-existent request (should return `null`)
  - Test that Redis key is generated correctly with `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX` prefix
  - Test that `redis.get()` is called with correct key
  - Test JSON parsing of valid JSON string (should return parsed object)
  - Test JSON parsing error handling (should catch `SyntaxError`, log error with request ID and error message, return `null`)
  - Test Redis connection error handling (should return `null` gracefully)
  - Test Redis operation error handling (should return `null` gracefully)
  - Test that error log includes request ID and error message when JSON parsing fails
- [ ] Test `removePendingRequest` method
  - Test removing existing request (should call `redis.del()` with correct key)
  - Test removing non-existent request (should still call `redis.del()`)
  - Test that Redis key is generated correctly with `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX` prefix
  - Test that info log is written with request ID
  - Test Redis connection error handling (should log error, may throw or handle gracefully)
  - Test Redis operation error handling (should log error, may throw or handle gracefully)
- [ ] Test Redis key generation (indirectly through method tests)
  - Verify that all methods use the correct Redis key format: `${REDIS_KEY_PREFIX}${requestId}`
  - Verify that `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX` constant is `'cursor_runner_callback:'`
- [ ] Test constants
  - Verify `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX` constant value is `'cursor_runner_callback:'`
  - Verify `DEFAULT_TTL` constant value is `3600` (1 hour in seconds)
- [ ] Test integration scenarios
  - Test complete flow: store → get → remove (should work end-to-end)
  - Test storing multiple requests with different IDs (should not interfere)
  - Test TTL expiration behavior (if testable with mocks)
- [ ] Achieve >80% code coverage
  - Run coverage report: `npm run test:coverage`
  - Verify all public methods are tested
  - Verify error paths are tested
  - Verify edge cases are tested

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 6. CursorRunnerCallbackService Conversion
- Subsection: 6.6
- Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb` for complete behavior details
- Reference the TypeScript implementation created in PHASE2-039 through PHASE2-043

**Rails Implementation Analysis:**

The Rails service (`cursor_runner_callback_service.rb`) has:

- Constructor: `initialize(redis_client: nil, redis_url: nil)` - accepts optional Redis client or URL (if `redis_client` is provided, it's used; otherwise, if `redis_url` is provided, a new client is created; otherwise, uses `ENV.fetch('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379/0')`)
- `store_pending_request(request_id, data, ttl: DEFAULT_TTL)` - stores JSON data in Redis with TTL using `setex`, logs info message with request_id and TTL
- `get_pending_request(request_id)` - retrieves and parses JSON data using `JSON.parse(data, symbolize_names: true)` (returns Hash with symbol keys), handles JSON parsing errors gracefully (returns nil), logs error on JSON parse failure
- `remove_pending_request(request_id)` - deletes key from Redis using `del`, logs info message with request_id
- Private `redis_key(request_id)` helper - generates key with prefix: `"#{REDIS_KEY_PREFIX}#{request_id}"`
- Constants: `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX = 'cursor_runner_callback:'`, `DEFAULT_TTL = 3600` (1 hour in seconds)
- Note: Rails uses `symbolize_names: true` in JSON.parse, but TypeScript/JavaScript doesn't have symbol keys - parsed objects will have string keys

**Test Requirements:**

1. **Mock Redis Client**: Use the existing `mockRedisClient` from `tests/mocks/redis.ts` which provides mocked methods: `get`, `set`, `del`, etc. Note: The mock may need `setex` method added if it's not already present (add `setex: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('OK')` to the mock object). When testing constructor with `redisUrl` parameter, you'll need to mock the `Redis` constructor from `ioredis` using `jest.mock('ioredis')` to return a mock instance.

2. **Test Structure**: Follow the project's test conventions:
   - Use `describe` blocks to group related tests
   - Use descriptive test names: `it('should return null when request does not exist', ...)`
   - Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
   - Reset mocks in `beforeEach` to ensure test isolation

3. **Redis Method Mocking**:
   - Mock `setex` for `storePendingRequest` tests (should be called with `key`, `ttl`, `jsonString`)
   - Mock `get` for `getPendingRequest` tests (should return `string | null`)
   - Mock `del` for `removePendingRequest` tests (should return number of keys deleted)

4. **Error Handling Tests**: Based on PHASE2-043, test:
   - Redis connection errors (network failures, connection refused, ECONNREFUSED, timeout errors)
   - Redis operation errors (write failures, command errors, memory errors)
   - JSON parsing errors (`SyntaxError` for invalid JSON - should return null gracefully)
   - TTL validation errors (if TTL validation was added in PHASE2-043: should validate TTL is positive integer > 0, should validate TTL is within bounds 1-86400)

5. **Logging Tests**: Verify that appropriate log messages are written:
   - Info logs for successful operations (store, remove)
   - Error logs for failures (JSON parsing errors, Redis errors)

6. **File Path**: The test file should be created at `tests/unit/services/cursor-runner-callback-service.test.ts` (not `tests/services/`)

7. **TypeScript vs Ruby Differences**:
   - Ruby's `JSON.parse(data, symbolize_names: true)` returns a Hash with symbol keys, but TypeScript's `JSON.parse()` returns a plain object with string keys - this is expected and correct
   - TypeScript doesn't have symbol keys like Ruby, so the parsed object will have string keys (e.g., `{ chat_id: 123 }` in Ruby becomes `{ "chat_id": 123 }` in TypeScript)
   - This difference is acceptable and doesn't need special handling in tests - just verify the parsed object structure matches expectations

**Dependencies:**

- Assumes `CursorRunnerCallbackService` class exists (from PHASE2-039)
- Assumes all methods are implemented (from PHASE2-040, PHASE2-041, PHASE2-042)
- Assumes error handling is added (from PHASE2-043)
- Assumes Redis mock exists at `tests/mocks/redis.ts`

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
