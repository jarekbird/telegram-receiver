# PHASE2-006: Create handler payload types (if needed)

**Section**: 1. TypeScript Type Definitions
**Subsection**: 1.6
**Task ID**: PHASE2-006

## Description

Create TypeScript type definitions for async handler payloads (if needed). Since we're using async handlers that accept TelegramUpdate directly, this task may not be needed, but can define types for handler execution if required.

## Checklist

- [ ] Determine if handler payload types are needed (handlers may accept TelegramUpdate directly)
- [ ] If needed, create `src/types/handlers.ts` file
- [ ] Import `TelegramUpdate` type from `src/types/telegram.ts` (created in PHASE2-001)
- [ ] If needed, define handler execution types (handlers typically accept TelegramUpdate directly, so this may not be needed)
- [ ] Export any types defined

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 1. TypeScript Type Definitions
- Reference `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` for handler payload structure
  - The `perform` method accepts `update` parameter (Hash or JSON string)
  - In Rails: `TelegramMessageJob.perform_later(update.to_json)` passes update as JSON string
  - In TypeScript/async handlers, handlers typically accept TelegramUpdate directly (no wrapper payload needed)
- Handlers will accept TelegramUpdate object directly (as defined in PHASE2-001)
- This type may not be needed since handlers accept TelegramUpdate directly: `handler.handle(update)`
- If handler execution wrappers are needed, they can use TelegramUpdate directly
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Dependency**: PHASE2-001 must be completed first (creates TelegramUpdate type)
- **Note**: This task may be optional if handlers accept TelegramUpdate directly without wrapper types

### Implementation Details

Based on the Rails implementation analysis:

1. **Handler Structure**: The Rails job's `perform` method accepts a single `update` parameter. In async handlers, handlers accept TelegramUpdate directly.

2. **Type Safety**: Handlers use TelegramUpdate type directly for type safety.

3. **Usage Pattern**:
   - When executing handler: `await handler.handle(telegramUpdate)` where `telegramUpdate` is of type `TelegramUpdate`
   - Handler signature: `async handle(update: TelegramUpdate): Promise<void>`

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
