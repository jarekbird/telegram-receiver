# PHASE2-004: Create Redis callback data types

**Section**: 1. TypeScript Type Definitions
**Subsection**: 1.4
**Task ID**: PHASE2-004

## Description

Create TypeScript type definitions for Redis callback data structures. These types define the structure of data stored in Redis for pending cursor-runner requests.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/types/redis-callback.ts` file
- [ ] Define `PendingRequestData` interface for stored callback data
- [ ] Define properties with correct TypeScript types:
  - `chat_id`: number (Telegram chat ID)
  - `message_id`: number (Telegram message ID)
  - `prompt`: string (the user's message text/prompt)
  - `original_was_audio?`: boolean (optional - whether the original message was an audio/voice message, defaults to false if undefined)
  - `created_at`: string (ISO8601 formatted timestamp)
- [ ] Export the interface

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 1. TypeScript Type Definitions
- Reference `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb` for service implementation
- Reference `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` (lines 193-199) for the actual data structure stored in Redis
  - The hash structure is: `{ chat_id, message_id, prompt, original_was_audio, created_at }`
  - Stored via `store_pending_request` method call (line 191)
- The data is stored as JSON in Redis with a TTL (default: 3600 seconds / 1 hour)
- When retrieved, `original_was_audio` may be undefined/null and should default to `false` (see `cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` line 104)
- The TypeScript interface should mark `original_was_audio` as optional (`original_was_audio?: boolean`) to reflect that it may be missing from stored data
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
