# PHASE2-002: Create Cursor Runner API types

**Section**: 1. TypeScript Type Definitions
**Subsection**: 1.2
**Task ID**: PHASE2-002

## Description

Create TypeScript type definitions for Cursor Runner API. These types will be used when communicating with the cursor-runner service for executing cursor commands and handling responses.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/types/cursor-runner.ts` file
- [ ] Define `CursorExecuteRequest` interface for execute endpoint
  - Fields: `repository` (string), `branchName` (string), `prompt` (string), `id` (string)
- [ ] Define `CursorIterateRequest` interface for iterate endpoint
  - Fields: `repository` (string), `branchName` (string), `prompt` (string), `maxIterations` (number, default: 25), `id` (string), `callbackUrl` (string, optional)
- [ ] Define `CursorExecuteResponse` interface for execute responses
  - Should include: `success` (boolean), `requestId` (string), `repository` (string), `branchName` (string), `output` (string), `error` (string, optional), `exitCode` (number), and other fields as returned by cursor-runner
- [ ] Define `CursorIterateResponse` interface for iterate responses
  - Should include: `success` (boolean), `requestId` (string), `repository` (string), `branchName` (string), `output` (string), `iterations` (number), `maxIterations` (number), `error` (string, optional), `exitCode` (number), `duration` (string, optional), and other fields as returned by cursor-runner
  - Note: If `callbackUrl` is provided, response may be immediate acknowledgment with minimal fields
- [ ] Define `CursorCallbackPayload` interface for callback webhooks
  - Fields: `success` (boolean), `requestId` (string), `repository` (string), `branchName` (string), `iterations` (number), `maxIterations` (number), `output` (string), `error` (string, optional), `exitCode` (number), `duration` (string, optional), `timestamp` (string, optional)
  - Note: Callback payload may use either camelCase or snake_case keys (normalize in implementation)
- [ ] Define `GitCloneRequest` interface for repository cloning
  - Fields: `repositoryUrl` (string), `repositoryName` (string, optional)
- [ ] Define `GitCloneResponse` interface for clone responses
  - Should include: `success` (boolean), `repository` (string), `message` (string, optional), and other fields as returned
- [ ] Define `GitListRepositoriesResponse` interface for list repositories response
  - Fields: `success` (boolean), `repositories` (string[]), `count` (number)
  - Note: `repositories` is an array of repository name strings, not objects
- [ ] Define `GitCheckoutRequest` interface for branch checkout
  - Fields: `repository` (string), `branch` (string)
- [ ] Define `GitCheckoutResponse` interface for checkout responses
  - Should include: `success` (boolean), `message` (string, optional), and other fields as returned
- [ ] Define `GitPushRequest` interface for pushing branches
  - Fields: `repository` (string), `branch` (string)
- [ ] Define `GitPushResponse` interface for push responses
  - Should include: `success` (boolean), `message` (string, optional), and other fields as returned
- [ ] Define `GitPullBranchRequest` interface for pulling branches
  - Fields: `repository` (string), `branch` (string)
  - Note: Named `GitPullBranchRequest` to avoid conflict with TypeScript's common `PullRequest` type
- [ ] Define `GitPullBranchResponse` interface for pull responses
  - Should include: `success` (boolean), `message` (string, optional), and other fields as returned
- [ ] Define `CursorRunnerError` interface for error responses
  - Fields: `error` (string), and potentially other error details
  - Note: HTTP errors (non-2xx) may include error details in response body
- [ ] Export all types and interfaces

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 1. TypeScript Type Definitions
- Reference `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb` for request/response structures
- Reference `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` for callback payload structure
- Types should match the API structure used by cursor-runner service
- Request field names use camelCase (e.g., `branchName`, `maxIterations`, `repositoryUrl`, `callbackUrl`)
- Response structures are JSON objects parsed with symbol keys in Rails (use camelCase in TypeScript)
- Callback payloads may use either camelCase or snake_case keys - implementation should normalize these
- Error responses may include an `error` field in the response body (see error handling in `cursor_runner_service.rb`)
- HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) is treated as a valid response with error details in body
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
