# PHASE2-084: Implement process_local_message method

**Section**: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
**Subsection**: 10.8
**Task ID**: PHASE2-084

## Description

Convert the `process_local_message` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This method processes local commands that are not forwarded to cursor-runner, handling /start, /help, /status commands and unknown messages. Reference `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` lines 253-277.

The method:

- Accepts message text, chat_id, and message_id as parameters
- Uses regex pattern matching (case-insensitive, trimmed) to identify commands
- Returns a response object with `ok` and `say` properties
- Handles /start and /help commands with the same response
- Handles /status command with a status message
- Returns a friendly response for unknown commands (not an error)

## Checklist

### Method Signature

- [ ] Create `processLocalMessage` method with signature: `processLocalMessage(text: string, chatId: number, messageId: number)`
- [ ] Method should return `{ ok: boolean, say: string }` object

### Command Handling

- [ ] Use regex pattern matching (case-insensitive) to match commands
- [ ] Trim and lowercase text before matching
- [ ] Handle /start command (matches `/^\/start/i`)
- [ ] Handle /help command (matches `/^\/help/i`)
- [ ] **Important**: /start and /help should return the same response message
- [ ] Handle /status command (matches `/^\/status/i`)
- [ ] Handle unknown commands (else clause) - should return a friendly response, not an error

### Response Format

- [ ] Return object with `ok: true` property
- [ ] Return object with `say` property containing the response text
- [ ] /start and /help response should include:
  - Greeting: "Hello! I'm your Virtual Assistant. Send me a message and I'll help you out."
  - Available commands list: "/help - Show this message" and "/status - Check my status"
- [ ] /status response should be: "✅ I'm online and ready to help!"
- [ ] Unknown commands response should include:
  - Echo of received message: "I received your message: {text}"
  - Learning message: "I'm still learning how to process messages. More features coming soon!"

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` lines 253-277

### Implementation Details

- The method uses a case statement (or switch statement in TypeScript) with regex patterns
- Commands are matched using regex patterns: `/^\/start/i`, `/^\/help/i`, `/^\/status/i`
- Text is normalized (downcased and stripped) before matching
- `/start` and `/help` commands are grouped together and return the same response
- Unknown commands (anything that doesn't match the above patterns) return a friendly response, not an error
- The return format is always `{ ok: true, say: string }` - the `ok` property is always `true`
- The `say` property contains the message text to be sent to the user
- This method is called from `handleMessage` when a message is not forwarded to cursor-runner
- **Note**: The `chatId` and `messageId` parameters are part of the method signature for consistency with the calling code, but they are not used within the method body in the Rails implementation

### Related Methods

- Called by: `handleMessage` method (when message is not forwarded to cursor-runner)
- The response object is used by `handleMessage` to send messages via `TelegramService.sendMessage` or `sendTextAsAudio`

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
