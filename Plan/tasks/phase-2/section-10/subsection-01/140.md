# PHASE2-077: Create TelegramMessageJob processor class

**Section**: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
**Subsection**: 10.1
**Task ID**: PHASE2-077

## Description

Convert the TelegramMessageJob processor class from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This job processes Telegram updates asynchronously, allowing the webhook endpoint to return 200 OK immediately. It handles messages, edited messages, and callback queries, with support for audio transcription, text-to-speech, and forwarding messages to cursor-runner.

Reference: `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb`

## Checklist

### File Structure

- [ ] Create `src/jobs/telegram-message-job.ts` file
- [ ] Create `src/jobs/` directory if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Extend base job processor class (ApplicationJob equivalent)
- [ ] Define job name constant (e.g., `JOB_NAME = 'telegram-message'`)
- [ ] Configure queue name (default queue)

### Core Functionality

- [ ] Implement `perform(update)` method - main entry point
  - [ ] Parse JSON string if update is a string
  - [ ] Convert update to allow string or number key access (equivalent to Rails `with_indifferent_access`)
  - [ ] Handle different update types (message, edited_message, callback_query)
  - [ ] Route to appropriate handler method
  - [ ] Log unhandled update types (log update keys if no handler matches)
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling with try-catch
  - [ ] Extract chat info from update for error messages
  - [ ] Send error message to Telegram if chat_id is available (use parse_mode: 'HTML')
  - [ ] Log all errors with stack traces
  - [ ] Re-raise errors after handling to mark job as failed

### Message Handling

- [ ] Implement `handleMessage(message)` method
  - [ ] Extract chat_id, text, and message_id from message (use safe navigation/optional chaining)
  - [ ] Track if original message was audio/voice (before transcription)
  - [ ] Check for audio/voice messages and transcribe if present
  - [ ] Replace text with transcribed text if transcription succeeds
  - [ ] Update message object with transcribed text (create copy of message object, set text property)
  - [ ] Handle transcription errors gracefully with user feedback
  - [ ] Truncate transcription error messages to 4000 characters (leave room for prefix text)
  - [ ] Return early if transcription fails (after sending error message)
  - [ ] Forward message to cursor-runner (returns true if forwarded)
  - [ ] Process local commands if not forwarded
  - [ ] Send response back to Telegram (only if result.say is present and chat_id is present)
  - [ ] Send response as audio if original was audio and audio output is enabled
  - [ ] Send response as text otherwise (use parse_mode: 'HTML')

### Callback Query Handling

- [ ] Implement `handleCallbackQuery(callbackQuery)` method
  - [ ] Extract message and data from callback query
  - [ ] Answer callback query with "Processing..." status using TelegramService.bot.api.answer_callback_query()
  - [ ] Handle errors when answering callback query gracefully (log but don't fail)
  - [ ] Return early if message or message.chat is missing
  - [ ] Extract chat_id and message_id from callback message
  - [ ] Forward callback data to cursor-runner as a prompt (create message-like object with text=data)
  - [ ] Send simple response if not forwarded ("You selected: {data}")

### Cursor Runner Integration

- [ ] Implement `forwardToCursorRunner(message, chatId, messageId, originalWasAudio?)` method
  - [ ] Extract message text, return false if blank
  - [ ] Skip local commands using regex pattern matching (/start, /help, /status) - case insensitive
  - [ ] Return false if chat_id is blank
  - [ ] Generate unique request ID (format: "telegram-{timestamp}-{random-hex-4-chars}")
  - [ ] Store pending request in Redis via CursorRunnerCallbackService
  - [ ] Store chat_id, message_id, prompt, original_was_audio, created_at (ISO8601 format)
  - [ ] Set TTL to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
  - [ ] Pass blank repository value ('') for Telegram messages
  - [ ] Call CursorRunnerService.iterate() with repository, branch_name='main', prompt, max_iterations=25, request_id
  - [ ] Log successful forwarding with request_id and truncated prompt (first 50 chars)
  - [ ] Send immediate acknowledgment if cursor debug is enabled (parse_mode: 'HTML')
  - [ ] Handle CursorRunnerService::Error exceptions specifically
  - [ ] Clean up pending request on error (remove from Redis)
  - [ ] Send error message to Telegram on failure (parse_mode: 'HTML')
  - [ ] Return true to indicate message was forwarded (even on error to prevent duplicate processing)

### Local Message Processing

- [ ] Implement `processLocalMessage(text, chatId, messageId)` method
  - [ ] Normalize text (downcase, strip whitespace) before matching
  - [ ] Handle `/start` and `/help` commands using regex pattern matching (case insensitive)
  - [ ] Handle `/status` command using regex pattern matching (case insensitive)
  - [ ] Return default response for other messages
  - [ ] Return object with `ok: true` and `say` properties (string message)
  - [ ] Help message should include available commands (/help, /status)

### Utility Methods

- [ ] Implement `extractChatInfoFromUpdate(update)` method
  - [ ] Extract chat_id and message_id from message updates (use safe navigation/optional chaining)
  - [ ] Extract chat_id and message_id from edited_message updates (use safe navigation)
  - [ ] Extract chat_id and message_id from callback_query updates (nested: callback_query.message.chat.id)
  - [ ] Return [chatId, messageId] tuple or [null, null] if not found
  - [ ] Handle missing chat or message objects gracefully

- [ ] Implement `extractAudioFileId(message)` method
  - [ ] Check for voice message (most common)
  - [ ] Check for audio file
  - [ ] Check for document with audio mime type

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation for behavior: `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb`

### Dependencies

This job depends on the following services (which should be converted in earlier tasks):

- TelegramService - for sending messages, downloading files, sending voice messages
- CursorRunnerService - for forwarding messages to cursor-runner
- CursorRunnerCallbackService - for storing pending requests in Redis
- ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService - for audio transcription
- ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService - for text-to-speech conversion
- SystemSetting - for checking debug mode and audio output settings

### Key Implementation Details

- The job processes updates asynchronously to allow webhook to return 200 OK immediately
- Updates can be passed as JSON strings or objects (parse if string)
- Use safe navigation/optional chaining when accessing nested properties (equivalent to Rails `&.` operator)
- Audio messages are transcribed before processing
- When audio is transcribed, the message object is updated with the transcribed text (create copy, don't mutate original)
- Messages are forwarded to cursor-runner unless they are local commands (/start, /help, /status) - use regex matching, case insensitive
- If original message was audio and audio output is NOT disabled, responses are sent as voice messages
- Request IDs are generated in format: "telegram-{timestamp}-{random-hex-4-chars}"
- Pending requests are stored in Redis with 1 hour TTL (3600 seconds)
- Error handling includes sending user-friendly messages to Telegram with parse_mode: 'HTML'
- File cleanup is critical - downloaded and generated audio files must be deleted in finally blocks
- Transcription error messages are truncated to 4000 characters (leaving room for prefix text)
- forwardToCursorRunner returns true even on error to prevent duplicate processing
- Callback queries are answered using TelegramService.bot.api.answer_callback_query()
- All Telegram messages use parse_mode: 'HTML' (including error messages and responses)
- CursorRunnerService.iterate() is called with max_iterations=25 and branch_name='main'

### Queue Configuration

- Queue name: "default"
- Should extend base async handler class (equivalent to ApplicationJob in Rails, but using async pattern instead of queue)
- Retry configuration: exponential backoff, 3 attempts (matches Rails ApplicationJob)
- Job should be retried on StandardError exceptions
- Job should be discarded on deserialization errors (if applicable)

### Task Scope

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- However, ensure dependent services are available or mocked for testing

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
