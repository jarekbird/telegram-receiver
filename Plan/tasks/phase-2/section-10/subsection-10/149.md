# PHASE2-086: Add error handling to TelegramMessageJob

**Section**: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
**Subsection**: 10.10
**Task ID**: PHASE2-086

## Description

Add comprehensive error handling to TelegramMessageJob methods in TypeScript/Node.js, ensuring all methods have proper try-catch blocks, error logging, and user-friendly error messages sent to Telegram. Reference `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` for error handling patterns.

The Rails implementation shows error handling patterns in:

- `perform` method (lines 32-51): Comprehensive error handling with chat info extraction, error messages to Telegram, logging, and re-raising
- `handle_message` method (lines 59-133):
  - Has error handling ONLY for audio transcription (lines 90-104) with user feedback
  - **NO overall try-catch wrapper** around the entire method
  - Errors in forwarding, local processing, or sending responses are NOT caught
- `handle_callback_query` method (lines 135-171):
  - Has error handling ONLY for answering callback queries (lines 142-149)
  - **NO overall try-catch wrapper** around the entire method
  - Errors in forwarding or sending responses are NOT caught
- `process_local_message` method (lines 253-277): **NO error handling at all**
- `forward_to_cursor_runner` method (lines 234-251): Error handling for CursorRunnerService errors
- `transcribe_audio` method (lines 315-352): Error handling for status messages and file cleanup
- `send_text_as_audio` method (lines 355-389): Error handling with fallback to text messages

  - [ ] Truncate error messages to fit Telegram's 4096 character limit when needed

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation for behavior: `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb`

### Error Handling Requirements

1. **Error Message Format**: Use user-friendly error messages when sending to Telegram users. The Rails implementation uses format: "Sorry, I encountered an error processing your message: {error.message}" (line 42)

2. **Error Message Truncation**: For long error messages (like transcription errors), truncate to fit Telegram's 4096 character limit. Rails implementation uses 4000 characters max, leaving room for prefix text (lines 94-96)

3. **Error Logging**: Always log both error message and full stack trace for debugging:

   ```typescript
   logger.error(`Error in method: ${error.message}`);
   logger.error(error.stack);
   ```

4. **Chat Info Extraction**: Use the `extractChatInfoFromUpdate()` helper function (implemented in PHASE2-063) to extract chat_id and message_id for error messages

5. **Nested Error Handling**: When sending error messages to Telegram, wrap the send call in try-catch to prevent infinite error loops (Rails lines 39-48)

6. **Job Failure Tracking**: Re-raise errors in the `perform` method to ensure the job system marks the job as failed for retry logic

7. **File Cleanup**: Always use `finally` blocks for file cleanup operations, and handle cleanup errors gracefully (log warnings, don't crash)

### Dependencies

This task depends on:

- PHASE2-063: `extractChatInfoFromUpdate` utility function
- PHASE2-078: `perform` method implementation
- PHASE2-079: `handleMessage` method implementation
- PHASE2-080: `handleCallbackQuery` method implementation
- PHASE2-083: `forwardToCursorRunner` method implementation
- PHASE2-082: `transcribeAudio` method implementation
- PHASE2-085: `sendTextAsAudio` method implementation

### Task Scope

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Focus on adding missing error handling to methods that don't have it
- Verify that existing error handling matches Rails patterns
- Ensure consistent error handling patterns across all methods

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
