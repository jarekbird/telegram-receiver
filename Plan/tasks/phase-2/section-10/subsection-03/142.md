# PHASE2-079: Implement handle_message method

**Section**: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
**Subsection**: 10.3
**Task ID**: PHASE2-079

## Description

Convert the `handle_message` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This method processes incoming Telegram messages, handles audio transcription, forwards messages to cursor-runner, and processes local commands. Reference `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` lines 59-133.

The method:

- Extracts message data (chat_id, text, message_id)
- Detects and transcribes audio/voice messages
- Forwards messages to cursor-runner (unless local command)
- Processes local commands if not forwarded
- Sends responses (as audio if original was audio, otherwise as text)

## Checklist

### Core Method Structure

- [ ] Create `handleMessage` method that accepts a Telegram message object
- [ ] Extract `chat_id` from `message.chat.id` (handle case where `chat` may be undefined/null)
- [ ] Extract `text` from `message.text` (may be undefined/null for non-text messages)
- [ ] Extract `message_id` from `message.message_id`
- [ ] Log the incoming message for debugging (include chat_id and text in log)

### Audio Detection and Transcription

- [ ] Track `original_was_audio` flag BEFORE checking for audio (using `extractAudioFileId` helper) - this flag determines response format
- [ ] Check for audio/voice using `extractAudioFileId` method (checks voice, audio, and document with audio mime_type)
- [ ] If audio detected:
  - [ ] Call `transcribeAudio` method with file_id, chat_id, and message_id
  - [ ] Handle transcription result (empty/falsy check):
    - [ ] If transcription returns empty/falsy value, send error message to user and return early
    - [ ] Error message: "❌ Sorry, I couldn't transcribe the audio message. Please try again or send a text message."
  - [ ] Handle transcription exceptions:
    - [ ] Wrap transcription call in try-catch block
    - [ ] On exception, log error with stack trace
    - [ ] Truncate error message to 4000 characters (to leave room for prefix text, Telegram limit is 4096)
    - [ ] Send error message: "❌ Error transcribing audio: {truncated_error}. Please try again or send a text message."
    - [ ] Return early after sending error
  - [ ] Replace `text` variable with transcribed text
  - [ ] Create a copy of message object (to avoid mutation issues) and update `message.text` with transcribed text
  - [ ] Log successful transcription (first 50 characters for debugging)

### Message Forwarding

- [ ] Call `forwardToCursorRunner` method with:
  - [ ] Message object (with transcribed text if applicable)
  - [ ] chat_id
  - [ ] message_id
  - [ ] `original_was_audio` flag as parameter
- [ ] Check return value (boolean) to determine if message was forwarded
- [ ] If forwarded, return early (don't process locally)

### Local Command Processing

- [ ] If not forwarded, call `processLocalMessage` with text, chat_id, and message_id
- [ ] Store result object (should have `say` property)
- [ ] Check if `result.say` is present before sending response
- [ ] Check if `chat_id` is present before sending response

### Response Handling

- [ ] Determine response type based on:
  - [ ] If `original_was_audio` is true AND `SystemSetting.disabled('allow_audio_output')` returns false (i.e., audio output is NOT disabled):
    - [ ] Call `sendTextAsAudio` method with chat_id, result.say, and message_id
  - [ ] Otherwise (if original was not audio OR audio output is disabled):
    - [ ] Call `TelegramService.sendMessage` with:
      - [ ] chat_id
      - [ ] text: result.say
      - [ ] reply_to_message_id: message_id
      - [ ] parse_mode: 'HTML'

### Error Handling

- [ ] Wrap transcription logic in try-catch block
- [ ] Send user-friendly error messages on transcription failures
- [ ] Handle edge cases (missing chat_id, empty text, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure proper error logging

### Dependencies

- [ ] Method depends on:
  - [ ] `extractAudioFileId` helper method (checks voice, audio, document with audio mime_type)
  - [ ] `transcribeAudio` method (downloads file, transcribes, cleans up)
  - [ ] `forwardToCursorRunner` method (forwards to cursor-runner API)
  - [ ] `processLocalMessage` method (handles /start, /help, /status commands)
  - [ ] `sendTextAsAudio` method (converts text to speech and sends as voice)
  - [ ] `TelegramService.sendMessage` (sends text messages)
  - [ ] `SystemSetting.disabled` (checks if audio output is disabled)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` lines 59-133

### Implementation Details

- The method processes both regular messages and edited messages (they use the same handler)
- Audio detection checks three sources: `message.voice`, `message.audio`, and `message.document` (with audio mime_type)
- The `original_was_audio` flag is tracked BEFORE checking for audio (line 67 in Rails) to determine response format - this ensures we know if the original message was audio even if transcription fails
- Transcription has two error paths:
  1. Empty/falsy result: Sends user-friendly error message and returns early
  2. Exception: Catches exception, logs with stack trace, truncates error to 4000 chars (leaves room for prefix), sends error message, and returns early
- Messages are forwarded to cursor-runner unless they are local commands (/start, /help, /status)
- Response format (audio vs text) depends on:
  - Whether the original message was audio (`original_was_audio` flag)
  - Whether audio output is disabled via SystemSetting (`SystemSetting.disabled('allow_audio_output')`)
- The method uses `processLocalMessage` for local command handling when not forwarded
- Error messages sent to users should be truncated to 4000 characters (to leave room for prefix text, Telegram limit is 4096)
- The message object is copied before mutation to avoid side effects (Rails uses `message.dup`)
- Successful transcriptions are logged (first 50 characters for debugging)

### Related Methods (may be implemented in other tasks)

- `extractAudioFileId` - Extracts audio file ID from message (voice, audio, or document)
- `transcribeAudio` - Downloads and transcribes audio using ElevenLabs
- `forwardToCursorRunner` - Forwards message to cursor-runner API
- `processLocalMessage` - Handles local commands like /start, /help, /status
- `sendTextAsAudio` - Converts text to speech and sends as voice message

### Dependencies

- `TelegramService` - For sending messages and downloading files
- `SystemSetting` - For checking feature flags (debug, allow_audio_output)
- `CursorRunnerService` - For forwarding messages (via forwardToCursorRunner)
- `ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService` - For audio transcription (via transcribeAudio)
- `ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService` - For text-to-speech (via sendTextAsAudio)

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent, but depends on helper methods that may be implemented in other tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
