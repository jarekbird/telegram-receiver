# PHASE2-087: Register async handler

**Section**: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
**Subsection**: 10.11
**Task ID**: PHASE2-087

## Description

Set up async handler registration for TelegramMessageHandler to handle message processing in TypeScript/Node.js. Since this application doesn't use a queue system, we leverage Node.js's asynchronous nature to process messages directly. This task converts the Sidekiq job queue infrastructure from Rails to async handler patterns in Node.js.

The Rails implementation uses:

- **Sidekiq** as the ActiveJob adapter (configured in `jarek-va/config/application.rb` line 31)
- **Sidekiq initializer** (`jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb`) for Redis connection and configuration
- **Sidekiq YAML config** (`jarek-va/config/sidekiq.yml`) for queue and concurrency settings
- **Sidekiq worker process** started separately (`bundle exec sidekiq` or Docker service)
- **TelegramMessageJob** uses `queue_as :default` (line 11 in `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb`)

The TypeScript/Node.js implementation should use:

- **Async handler pattern** (using Node.js native async/await)
- **Async utilities** from `src/utils/async.ts` for retry and error handling
- **Base async handler** from `src/handlers/base-async-handler.ts` (if using base class pattern)
- **Direct async execution** instead of queue-based processing

## Checklist

### Async Handler Registration

- [ ] Create `src/handlers/telegram-message-handler.ts` or use existing handler
  - [ ] Import TelegramMessageHandler class (created in previous tasks, may be named TelegramMessageJob)
  - [ ] Ensure handler extends BaseAsyncHandler (if using base class pattern from PHASE2-015)
  - [ ] Implement `handle(update: TelegramUpdate): Promise<void>` method
  - [ ] Handle update data parsing (JSON string or object, matching Rails line 17-18)
  - [ ] Ensure handler matches Rails `perform` method signature: `handle(update)` (TypeScript method name is `handle`, Rails equivalent is `perform`)
  - [ ] Reference Rails implementation: `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` lines 10-51
  - [ ] Reference TypeScript implementation: PHASE2-078 for handler method signature

### Async Processing Setup

- [ ] Set up async processing with retry and error handling
  - [ ] Use async utilities from `src/utils/async.ts` (from PHASE2-014)
  - [ ] Wrap handler execution with `withRetry` for retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
  - [ ] Wrap handler execution with `withTimeout` for timeout handling
  - [ ] Use error handling utilities from `src/handlers/async-error-handler.ts` (from PHASE2-016)
  - [ ] Configure retry attempts: 3 (matching Rails `Sidekiq.default_job_options` line 35)
  - [ ] Enable backtrace logging: true (matching Rails line 36)
  - [ ] Reference Rails implementation: `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` lines 34-37

### Handler Execution

- [ ] Create handler execution function for use in controllers
  - [ ] Create `src/handlers/index.ts` or similar entry point
  - [ ] Export function to execute TelegramMessageHandler: `executeTelegramMessageHandler(update: TelegramUpdate): Promise<void>`
  - [ ] Function should wrap handler with retry, timeout, and error handling
  - [ ] Function should return Promise that resolves when handler completes
  - [ ] This function will be called by TelegramController to process messages (equivalent to Rails `TelegramMessageJob.perform_later(update.to_json)`)
  - [ ] Handler should accept `TelegramUpdate` directly (not wrapped in job payload)

### Error Handling

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
  - [ ] Handle handler execution errors
  - [ ] Log errors with appropriate log level and full stack traces
  - [ ] Use async error handling utilities from PHASE2-016
  - [ ] Ensure errors don't crash the application
  - [ ] Reference Rails Sidekiq error handling patterns

### Logging Configuration

- [ ] Configure handler logging
  - [ ] Set log level to INFO (matching Rails `Sidekiq.logger.level = Logger::INFO` line 31)
  - [ ] Ensure handler logs processing events (start, complete, error)
  - [ ] Log handler execution status
  - [ ] Reference Rails implementation: `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` line 31

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation for behavior

### Rails Implementation Details

1. **Sidekiq Configuration** (`jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb`):
   - Redis URL: `ENV.fetch('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379/0')`
   - Default job options: `{ retry: 3, backtrace: true }`
   - Log level: `Logger::INFO`

2. **Sidekiq YAML Config** (`jarek-va/config/sidekiq.yml`):
   - Development: concurrency 2, queues: ['default']
   - Production: concurrency 10, queues: ['critical', 'default', 'high_priority', 'low_priority']
   - Test: concurrency 1, queues: ['default']

3. **TelegramMessageJob Queue** (`jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` line 11):
   - Uses `queue_as :default` to specify queue name

4. **Handler Execution** (`jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb` line 22):
   - Jobs are enqueued via `TelegramMessageJob.perform_later(update.to_json)` in Rails
   - In TypeScript: Call async handler directly: `await executeTelegramMessageHandler(update)` or `await handler.handle(update)`

### TypeScript/Node.js Implementation Notes

1. **Async Handler Setup**:
   - Use Node.js native async/await (no queue system needed)
   - Create handler instance or use handler class directly
   - Execute handler asynchronously with proper error handling
   - Use async utilities for retry and timeout

2. **Handler Execution**:
   - Handler: Processes messages directly (equivalent to Rails job `perform` method)
     - Handler function receives `TelegramUpdate` and calls `TelegramMessageHandler.handle(update)`
   - Execution: Call handler directly with async/await (equivalent to `perform_later` in Rails)
     - Example: `await executeTelegramMessageHandler(update)` or `await handler.handle(update)`

3. **No Environment Variables Needed**:
   - No Redis connection needed for queue system
   - Note: Redis may still be used for other purposes (callback state, etc.)

4. **Handler Execution**:
   - Runs in same process as Express app (no separate worker process needed)
   - Handlers execute asynchronously when called
   - Ensure proper error handling to prevent crashes

### Dependencies

This task depends on:

- PHASE2-078: TelegramMessageHandler `handle` method implementation (TypeScript equivalent of Rails `perform` method)
- PHASE2-077: TelegramMessageHandler class structure
- PHASE2-015: BaseAsyncHandler class (if using base class pattern)
- PHASE2-014: Async utilities (withRetry, withTimeout, etc.)
- PHASE2-016: Async error handling utilities
- PHASE2-006: TelegramUpdate type definition (handler accepts TelegramUpdate directly)

### Task Scope

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Focus on setting up async handler execution infrastructure
- Ensure handler execution matches Rails job processing behavior
- Handler should process updates directly (no queue needed)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
