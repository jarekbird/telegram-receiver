# PHASE2-080: Implement handle_callback_query method

**Section**: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
**Subsection**: 10.4
**Task ID**: PHASE2-080

## Description

Convert the `handle_callback_query` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This method processes Telegram callback queries (button presses) by answering the callback, extracting the callback data, and forwarding it to cursor-runner as a prompt. If not forwarded, it sends a simple response message to the user.

Reference: `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` (lines 135-171)

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `handleCallbackQuery(callbackQuery)` method
  - [ ] Accept callbackQuery parameter (Telegram callback query object)
  - [ ] Extract `message` from `callbackQuery.message`
  - [ ] Extract `data` from `callbackQuery.data`
  - [ ] Log the callback query data for debugging: "Received callback query: {data}"
  - [ ] Answer the callback query with "Processing..." status
    - [ ] Use `TelegramService.bot.api.answerCallbackQuery()` or equivalent
    - [ ] Pass `callback_query_id` from `callbackQuery.id`
    - [ ] Pass `text: 'Processing...'`
    - [ ] Wrap in try-catch to handle errors gracefully
    - [ ] Log errors if answering callback query fails (don't fail the entire method)
  - [ ] Validate that message and message.chat exist (return early if not)
  - [ ] Extract `chat_id` from `message.chat.id`
  - [ ] Extract `message_id` from `message.message_id`
  - [ ] Forward callback data to cursor-runner
    - [ ] Create a message-like object: `{ text: data, message_id: message_id }`
    - [ ] Call `forwardToCursorRunner(messageObject, chatId, messageId)`
    - [ ] Store the return value (boolean indicating if forwarded)
  - [ ] If not forwarded to cursor-runner, send simple response
    - [ ] Use `TelegramService.sendMessage()`
    - [ ] Send to `chat_id`
    - [ ] Message text: `"You selected: {data}"`
    - [ ] Return early after sending response
  - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
    - [ ] Handle errors when answering callback query (log but continue)
    - [ ] Handle errors when forwarding to cursor-runner (handled by forwardToCursorRunner)
    - [ ] Handle errors when sending response message

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation for behavior: `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` (lines 135-171)

### Key Implementation Details

- **Method Signature**: `handleCallbackQuery(callbackQuery: TelegramCallbackQuery): Promise<void>`
- **Callback Query Structure**:
  - `callbackQuery.id` - unique identifier for the callback query
  - `callbackQuery.data` - data payload from the button press
  - `callbackQuery.message` - the original message that contained the button
- **Answering Callback Query**:
  - Must answer the callback query to acknowledge receipt (prevents loading spinner)
  - Uses text "Processing..." to inform user
  - Errors in answering should be logged but not fail the method
- **Message Validation**:
  - Must check that `message` and `message.chat` exist before proceeding
  - Return early if validation fails (prevents errors)
- **Forwarding to Cursor Runner**:
  - Creates a message-like object with `text: data` and `message_id`
  - Uses the same `forwardToCursorRunner` method as regular messages
  - This allows callback data to be processed by cursor-runner as a prompt
- **Fallback Response**:
  - If message is not forwarded (e.g., local command or error), send simple response
  - Response format: "You selected: {data}"
  - This provides user feedback for button presses

### Dependencies

This method depends on:

- `TelegramService` - for answering callback queries and sending messages
  - `TelegramService.bot.api.answerCallbackQuery()` or equivalent method
  - `TelegramService.sendMessage()` method
- `forwardToCursorRunner()` method - for forwarding callback data to cursor-runner
  - Should be implemented in PHASE2-077 or earlier task
- Logging utilities - for debugging and error logging

### Task Scope

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Requires `forwardToCursorRunner` method to be available (can be stubbed for testing)

## Related Tasks

- Previous: PHASE2-079
- Next: PHASE2-081

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
