# PHASE2-082: Implement transcribe_audio method

**Section**: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
**Subsection**: 10.6
**Task ID**: PHASE2-082

## Description

Convert the `transcribe_audio` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This method transcribes audio files from Telegram messages using the ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text API. Reference `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` lines 315-352.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `transcribeAudio` method with signature: `transcribeAudio(fileId: string, chatId: number, messageId: number): Promise<string>`
- [ ] Send optional status message "🎤 Transcribing audio..." if cursor debug is enabled (check SystemSetting for 'debug')
- [ ] Wrap status message sending in try-catch that logs errors but doesn't propagate (transcription must proceed even if status message fails)
- [ ] Download audio file from Telegram using `TelegramService.downloadFile(fileId)` - returns file path
- [ ] Transcribe audio using `ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService.transcribe(audioPath)` - returns transcribed text
- [ ] Return transcribed text string
- [ ] Implement file cleanup in finally/ensure block to delete downloaded audio file (always runs, even on error)
- [ ] Handle errors appropriately - method should propagate errors to caller (caller handles error messages to user)
- [ ] Log operations: file download, transcription success, file cleanup

## Implementation Details

### Method Signature

```typescript
private async transcribeAudio(
  fileId: string,
  chatId: number,
  messageId: number
): Promise<string>
```

### Key Implementation Points

1. **Status Message (Optional)**: If cursor debug is enabled (check `SystemSetting.enabled('debug')`), send a status message "🎤 Transcribing audio..." to the user before starting transcription.
   - **Important**: Wrap status message sending in try-catch that logs errors but does NOT propagate them
   - If status message sending fails, transcription should still proceed
   - This ensures transcription isn't blocked by status message failures

2. **File Download**: Use `TelegramService.downloadFile(fileId)` which:
   - Gets file info from Telegram API
   - Downloads file to temp directory
   - Returns the local file path

3. **Transcription**: Use `ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService.transcribe(audioPath)` which:
   - Takes the local file path
   - Uploads to ElevenLabs API
   - Returns transcribed text string

4. **File Cleanup**: Always clean up the downloaded file in a finally block:
   - Check if file exists before deleting
   - Log cleanup operations
   - Handle cleanup errors gracefully (log warning, don't throw)

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Status message errors: Catch and log, but do NOT propagate (transcription must proceed)
   - Download/transcription errors: Propagate to caller (caller handles user error messages)
   - Cleanup errors: Catch and log warnings, do NOT propagate (cleanup failures shouldn't block method completion)
   - The caller (`handleMessage` method) handles sending error messages to users for download/transcription failures

### Dependencies

- `TelegramService.downloadFile(fileId: string): Promise<string>` - Downloads file and returns local path
- `ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService.transcribe(audioPath: string): Promise<string>` - Transcribes audio file
- `SystemSetting.enabled(key: string): boolean` - Check if debug mode is enabled
- `TelegramService.sendMessage()` - Send status/error messages

### Rails Implementation Reference

Located at `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` lines 315-352. The method:

- Sends status message if debug enabled (lines 317-328) - wrapped in begin/rescue that catches and logs errors without propagating
- Downloads file using `TelegramService.download_file(file_id)` (line 333)
- Transcribes using `ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService.new.transcribe(audio_path)` (line 338)
- Returns transcribed text (line 340)
- Cleans up file in ensure block (lines 341-350) - wrapped in begin/rescue that catches and logs cleanup errors without propagating

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 10. TelegramMessageJob Conversion
- The method is called from `handleMessage` when an audio/voice message is detected
- Errors are handled by the caller, not within this method
- File cleanup must always occur, even if transcription fails
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
