# PHASE2-062: Add error handling to TelegramController

**Section**: 8. TelegramController Conversion
**Subsection**: 8.8
**Task ID**: PHASE2-062

## Description

Add comprehensive error handling to all TelegramController handler methods. This task ensures that all endpoints (`webhook`, `setWebhook`, `getWebhookInfo`, `deleteWebhook`) have proper error handling that matches the Rails implementation behavior.

**Rails Implementation Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb`

**Key Error Handling Patterns**:

- **webhook handler** (lines 26-48): Must always return 200 OK to Telegram, extract chat info, attempt to send error message to user
- **Admin handlers** (`set_webhook`, `webhook_info`, `delete_webhook`): Return JSON error responses with 500 status, log errors

## Checklist

### Error Handling for `webhook` Handler

- [ ] Wrap handler logic in try-catch block
- [ ] Catch all errors (StandardError equivalent)
- [ ] Log error message using logger: `"Error handling Telegram webhook: #{error.message}"`
- [ ] Log error stack trace using logger (convert backtrace array to string)
- [ ] Convert update to plain object if needed (handle Hash/object conversion like Rails: `update.is_a?(Hash) ? update : update.to_h`)
- [ ] Extract chat info from update using `extractChatInfoFromUpdate` helper method (from PHASE2-063)
- [ ] If chat_id is available, attempt to send error message to user via TelegramService:
  - [ ] Use `TelegramService.sendMessage()` with error message text: `"Sorry, I encountered an error processing your message: #{error.message}"`
  - [ ] Include `reply_to_message_id` if available
  - [ ] Include `parse_mode: 'HTML'` parameter
  - [ ] Wrap TelegramService call in try-catch to handle send failures gracefully
  - [ ] Log send error if TelegramService call fails: `"Error sending error message: #{send_error.message}"`
- [ ] Always return 200 OK status to Telegram (even on error) to prevent retries
- [ ] Reference Rails implementation lines 26-48 for exact behavior

### Error Handling for Admin Handlers (`setWebhook`, `getWebhookInfo`, `deleteWebhook`)

- [ ] Wrap each handler method in try-catch block
- [ ] Catch all errors (StandardError equivalent)
- [ ] Log error message using logger with format: `"Error [operation]: #{error.message}"` (e.g., "Error setting webhook: ...")
- [ ] Log error stack trace using logger (convert backtrace array to string)
- [ ] Return JSON error response: `{ ok: false, error: error.message }` with HTTP 500 status
- [ ] Ensure error handling doesn't interfere with admin authentication checks (401 responses)
- [ ] Error handling should be placed after authentication checks (authentication failures return 401, not 500)
- [ ] Reference Rails implementation:
  - `set_webhook`: lines 64-70
  - `webhook_info`: lines 82-88
  - `delete_webhook`: lines 100-106

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 8. TelegramController Conversion
- **Important**: The `webhook` handler has special error handling requirements - it must always return 200 OK to Telegram to prevent retries, even when errors occur
- Admin handlers (`setWebhook`, `getWebhookInfo`, `deleteWebhook`) return JSON error responses with 500 status
- The `extractChatInfoFromUpdate` helper method is implemented in PHASE2-063 - use it if available, otherwise implement inline for this task
- **Update Conversion**: The update object may need to be converted to a plain object before passing to `extractChatInfoFromUpdate` (Rails uses `update.is_a?(Hash) ? update : update.to_h`)
- **Error Message Format**: When sending error messages to Telegram users, use the exact format: `"Sorry, I encountered an error processing your message: #{error.message}"` with `parse_mode: 'HTML'`
- Error logging should use the application logger (not console.log)
- Log both error message and full stack trace for debugging purposes
- When sending error messages to Telegram users, wrap the TelegramService call in its own try-catch to prevent error handling failures from causing additional errors
- Admin handler error messages should include the operation name in the log message (e.g., "Error setting webhook:", "Error getting webhook info:", "Error deleting webhook:")
- Reference the Rails implementation (`jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb`) for exact error handling patterns
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

- Next: PHASE2-063

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
