# PHASE2-057: Implement webhook authentication middleware

**Section**: 8. TelegramController Conversion
**Subsection**: 8.3
**Task ID**: PHASE2-057

## Description

Convert and implement webhook authentication middleware from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This middleware authenticates incoming Telegram webhook requests by validating the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header against a configured secret.

**Rails Implementation Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb` (lines 134-143)

**Rails Implementation Details**:

- The `authenticate_webhook` method is a private method in `TelegramController`
- It's used as a `before_action` filter (line 9) that only applies to the `webhook` action
- Gets the secret token from the `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` request header
- Gets the expected secret from `Rails.application.config.telegram_webhook_secret`
- Allows the request if:
  - The expected secret is blank/not configured (development mode), OR
  - The provided secret token matches the expected secret
- Returns 401 Unauthorized if the secret is configured but doesn't match
- Logs a warning message when authentication fails: "Unauthorized Telegram webhook request - invalid secret token"

**Configuration**:

- The webhook secret is configured via `Rails.application.config.telegram_webhook_secret`
- Can be set via Rails credentials (`telegram.webhook_secret`) or ENV variable (`TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
- Defaults to `'changeme'` if not set (see `jarek-va/config/application.rb` lines 44-45)

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `authenticateWebhook` Express middleware function
- [ ] Extract `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header from request
- [ ] Get expected secret from application configuration (environment variable `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` or config)
- [ ] Implement authentication logic:
  - [ ] Allow request if expected secret is blank/not configured (development mode)
  - [ ] Allow request if provided token matches expected secret
  - [ ] Return 401 Unauthorized if secret is configured but doesn't match
- [ ] Log warning message when authentication fails: "Unauthorized Telegram webhook request - invalid secret token"
- [ ] Apply middleware to Telegram webhook route only (not admin routes)
- [ ] Ensure middleware calls `next()` to continue request processing when authentication succeeds
- [ ] Ensure middleware returns 401 response and does not call `next()` when authentication fails

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 8. TelegramController Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation in `jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb` for exact behavior
- The middleware should be applied only to the webhook endpoint, similar to how Rails uses `before_action :authenticate_webhook, only: [:webhook]`
- In Express, this will be a middleware function that can be applied to specific routes
- Test cases should verify:
  - Request is allowed when secret is not configured
  - Request is allowed when header token matches configured secret
  - Request is rejected (401) when secret is configured but header token doesn't match
  - Request is rejected (401) when secret is configured but header is missing

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

- Next: PHASE2-058

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
