# PHASE2-056: Implement webhook endpoint handler

**Section**: 8. TelegramController Conversion
**Subsection**: 8.2
**Task ID**: PHASE2-056

## Description

Convert the webhook endpoint handler from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This endpoint receives Telegram updates via POST request, parses them, and enqueues them for asynchronous processing. The handler must return 200 OK immediately to Telegram to prevent retries, even if errors occur.

Reference the Rails implementation in `jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb` (lines 12-48) for the complete behavior.

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `webhook` handler method with signature `webhook(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void>`
- [ ] Parse request body as TelegramUpdate:
  - [ ] Check Content-Type header for `application/json`
  - [ ] If JSON, parse from request body directly
  - [ ] If form-encoded, parse from request body/form data
  - [ ] Handle both content types appropriately (similar to Rails `request.parameters` vs `params`)
- [ ] Remove framework-specific parameters from parsed update:
  - [ ] Remove `controller`, `action`, `format`, `telegram` parameters (if present)
  - [ ] Ensure only Telegram update data remains
- [ ] Log the received Telegram update for debugging (using logger with `update.inspect` equivalent)
- [ ] Execute async handler to process update asynchronously (call `TelegramMessageHandler` equivalent with TelegramUpdate object)
- [ ] Return 200 OK immediately after starting async handler execution (before handler processing completes)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling:
  - [ ] Catch all errors (StandardError equivalent - catch all exceptions)
  - [ ] Log error message and stack trace (full backtrace)
  - [ ] Convert update to plain object/hash if needed (handle both Hash and object types)
  - [ ] Extract chat info from update using `extractChatInfoFromUpdate` helper method (if available)
  - [ ] If chat_id is available, attempt to send error message to user via TelegramService:
    - [ ] Use `parse_mode: 'HTML'` when sending error message
    - [ ] Include `reply_to_message_id` if message_id is available
    - [ ] Wrap error message sending in try-catch to handle send failures gracefully
    - [ ] Log any errors from sending error message (but don't re-raise)
  - [ ] Always return 200 OK even on error (to prevent Telegram from retrying)
- [ ] Reference `jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb` lines 12-48 for implementation details

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 8. TelegramController Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation (`jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb` lines 12-48) for complete behavior
- **Important**: The webhook authentication is handled by middleware (implemented in PHASE2-057), so this method assumes authentication has already passed
- The Rails implementation:
  - Checks Content-Type: if `application/json`, uses `request.parameters`; otherwise uses `params` (handles form-encoded)
  - Removes Rails-specific params (`controller`, `action`, `format`, `telegram`) using `update.except(...)` before processing
  - Logs the received update using `Rails.logger.info("Received Telegram update: #{update.inspect}")`
  - Converts update to JSON string using `update.to_json` before passing to job
  - Always returns 200 OK to Telegram, even on errors, to prevent retries
  - Error handling:
    - Converts update to hash if needed: `update_hash = update.is_a?(Hash) ? update : update.to_h`
    - Extracts chat info using `extract_chat_info_from_update(update_hash)` private method
    - Sends error message with `parse_mode: 'HTML'` and `reply_to_message_id` if available
    - Wraps error message sending in nested try-catch to handle send failures gracefully
    - Logs send errors but doesn't re-raise them
- The `extractChatInfoFromUpdate` helper method may be implemented in a later task (PHASE2-063), but should be used here if available
- Error handling must be robust: log errors, attempt user notification, but always return 200 OK
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
