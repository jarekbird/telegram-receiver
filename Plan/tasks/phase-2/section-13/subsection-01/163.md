# PHASE2-100: Create service test fixtures

**Section**: 13. Testing
**Subsection**: 13.1
**Task ID**: PHASE2-100

## Description

Create service test fixtures for Telegram updates. These fixtures should provide reusable test data for Telegram update objects that match the Telegram Bot API format, including message updates, edited messages, and callback queries.

## Rails Reference

Reference the following Rails test files for examples of Telegram update structures:

- `jarek-va/spec/controllers/telegram_controller_spec.rb` - Shows update structures for messages, edited_messages, and callback_queries
- `jarek-va/spec/jobs/telegram_message_job_spec.rb` - Shows message update structures with commands and non-command messages
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` - Shows how updates are processed (handles `update['message']`, `update['edited_message']`, `update['callback_query']`)

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `tests/fixtures/telegram-updates.ts`
- [ ] Create sample message updates:
  - [ ] Command message (`/start` command)
  - [ ] Command message (`/help` command)
  - [ ] Command message (`/status` command)
  - [ ] Non-command text message (for forwarding to cursor-runner)
  - [ ] Message with minimal required fields (for edge case testing)
- [ ] Create sample callback queries:
  - [ ] Callback query with data and message reference
  - [ ] Callback query with minimal fields
- [ ] Create sample edited messages:
  - [ ] Edited message with text update
  - [ ] Edited message with minimal fields
- [ ] Export all fixtures for use in tests
- [ ] Include helper function to create custom updates with overrides (similar to existing `createTelegramMessage` pattern)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 13. Testing
- Reference the Rails implementation for behavior
- Telegram updates follow the format: `{ 'message': {...} }`, `{ 'edited_message': {...} }`, or `{ 'callback_query': {...} }`
- Update objects should match the Telegram Bot API Update structure
- Consider creating fixtures that match the test data used in Rails specs (see `telegram_controller_spec.rb` and `telegram_message_job_spec.rb`)
- The existing `tests/fixtures/telegramMessages.ts` file contains some fixtures but uses `update_id` at the top level; this new file should focus on the update wrapper structure used by the application

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
