# PHASE2-101: Create controller test fixtures

**Section**: 13. Testing
**Subsection**: 13.2
**Task ID**: PHASE2-101

## Description

Create comprehensive API response fixtures for controller tests. These fixtures should match the response structures returned by external APIs (Telegram Bot API, Cursor Runner API, ElevenLabs API) as used in the Rails application. The fixtures will be used to mock external API responses in controller tests when testing services that call these APIs.

## Checklist

- [ ] Update `tests/fixtures/apiResponses.ts` (file already exists, needs expansion)
- [ ] Create Telegram Bot API response fixtures:
  - [ ] `sendMessage` response: `{ ok: true, result: { message_id: number, date: number, text: string, chat: { id: number, type: string }, from: { id: number, ... } } }`
  - [ ] `setWebhook` response: `{ ok: true, result: true, description: string }`
  - [ ] `deleteWebhook` response: `{ ok: true, result: true, description: string }`
  - [ ] `getWebhookInfo` (webhookInfo) response: `{ ok: true, result: { url: string, pending_update_count: number, ... } }`
  - [ ] Error responses: `{ ok: false, description: string, error_code?: number }`
- [ ] Create Cursor Runner API response fixtures:
  - [ ] `execute` response: `{ success: true, requestId: string, repository: string, branchName: string, output: string, exitCode: number }`
  - [ ] `iterate` response: `{ success: true, requestId: string, repository: string, branchName: string, iterations: number, output: string, exitCode: number }`
  - [ ] `clone` response: `{ success: true, repository: string, message: string }`
  - [ ] `checkout` response: `{ success: true, message: string }`
  - [ ] `push` response: `{ success: true, message: string }`
  - [ ] `pull` response: `{ success: true, message: string }`
  - [ ] `repositories` response: `{ success: true, repositories: string[], count: number }`
  - [ ] Callback success response: `{ success: true, requestId: string, iterations: number, output: string, duration: string }`
  - [ ] Callback error response: `{ success: false, requestId: string, error: string }`
  - [ ] Error responses: `{ success: false, error: string }`
- [ ] Create ElevenLabs API response fixtures:
  - [ ] Speech-to-text success: `{ text: string }`
  - [ ] Speech-to-text error: `{ detail: string }` or `{ error: string }` or array format
  - [ ] Text-to-speech: Note that TTS returns binary audio data (Buffer), not JSON
- [ ] Add helper functions to create custom responses with overrides
- [ ] Export all fixtures properly

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 13. Testing
- The file `tests/fixtures/apiResponses.ts` already exists but is minimal - it needs to be expanded with comprehensive fixtures
- Reference the Rails service specs (`telegram_service_spec.rb`) and controller specs to understand exact response structures
- Fixtures should match the actual external API response formats (what services receive from Telegram, Cursor Runner, ElevenLabs APIs)
- These are NOT controller response formats - they are the raw API responses that services parse
- Include both success and error response variants
- Helper functions should allow easy customization of fixtures for specific test cases (similar to `createTelegramMessage` pattern in `telegramMessages.ts`)
- For Telegram API, the `result` object in success responses contains the actual data (message object, webhook info, etc.)
- For Cursor Runner API, responses use camelCase keys (e.g., `requestId`, `branchName`, `exitCode`)
- For ElevenLabs TTS, note that it returns binary audio data (Buffer/ArrayBuffer), not JSON - fixtures should represent this appropriately

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
