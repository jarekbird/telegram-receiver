# PHASE2-031: Implement iterate method

**Section**: 5. CursorRunnerService Conversion
**Subsection**: 5.4
**Task ID**: PHASE2-031

## Description

Convert the `iterate` method from Rails CursorRunnerService to TypeScript/Node.js. This method executes a cursor command iteratively until completion by calling the cursor-runner API's `/cursor/iterate` endpoint.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb` (lines 51-66)

## Method Signature

```typescript
iterate(params: {
  repository: string;
  branchName: string;
  prompt: string;
  maxIterations?: number;
  requestId?: string;
  callbackUrl?: string;
}): Promise<CursorIterateResponse>
```

**Parameters**:

- `repository` (required): Repository name (must be locally cloned)
- `branchName` (required): Branch name to checkout (note: camelCase, not snake_case)
- `prompt` (required): Prompt text for cursor to execute
- `maxIterations` (optional): Maximum number of iterations (default: 25)
- `requestId` (optional): Request ID for tracking. If not provided, should be auto-generated
- `callbackUrl` (optional): Callback URL for async completion notification. If provided, the response will be immediate and the actual result will be sent to the callback URL when complete

**Return Type**: Promise resolving to `CursorIterateResponse` (defined in PHASE2-002) with `success`, `output`, `iterations`, `maxIterations`, `error`, `exitCode`, `duration`, etc.

## Implementation Details

### Request Body Structure

The method should POST to `/cursor/iterate` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "repository": "<repository>",
  "branchName": "<branch_name>",
  "prompt": "<prompt>",
  "maxIterations": <max_iterations>,
  "id": "<request_id>",
  "callbackUrl": "<callback_url>"
}
```

**Important Notes**:

- The request body uses `branchName` (camelCase), not `branch_name` (snake_case)
- The request body uses `maxIterations` (camelCase), not `max_iterations` (snake_case)
- The `callbackUrl` field should only be included in the request body if it is provided (conditionally added)
- The `id` field contains the `requestId` value

### Request ID Generation

- If `requestId` is not provided, generate one using the format: `req-{timestamp}-{randomHex}`
- Example: `req-1234567890-a1b2c3d4`
- Use current Unix timestamp and 4 bytes of random hex (8 hex characters)

### Response Parsing

- Parse the JSON response body
- Return the parsed object with symbol keys (or equivalent TypeScript object)
- Handle JSON parsing errors appropriately
- Note: If `callbackUrl` is provided, the response will be immediate and the actual result will be sent to the callback URL when complete

### Error Handling

The method should handle and potentially throw the following error types:

- **ConnectionError**: Failed to connect to cursor-runner (ECONNREFUSED, EHOSTUNREACH, SocketError)
- **TimeoutError**: Request timed out (OpenTimeout, ReadTimeout)
- **InvalidResponseError**: Failed to parse JSON response
- **Error**: HTTP error responses (non-2xx, non-422 status codes)
  - Note: 422 Unprocessable Entity should be treated as a valid response (operation failed but request was valid)

### HTTP Request Details

- Method: POST
- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Accept: `application/json`
- Use the base URL from configuration (cursor-runner URL)
- Use timeout from configuration (cursor-runner timeout)

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `iterate` method with correct TypeScript signature
- [ ] Accept required parameters: `repository`, `branchName`, `prompt`
- [ ] Accept optional `maxIterations` parameter (default: 25)
- [ ] Accept optional `requestId` parameter
- [ ] Accept optional `callbackUrl` parameter
- [ ] Generate `requestId` if not provided (format: `req-{timestamp}-{randomHex}`)
- [ ] Build request body with correct structure (`repository`, `branchName`, `prompt`, `maxIterations`, `id`)
- [ ] Conditionally add `callbackUrl` to request body only if provided
- [ ] Ensure `branchName` is sent as camelCase in request body
- [ ] Ensure `maxIterations` is sent as camelCase in request body
- [ ] POST to `/cursor/iterate` endpoint (NOT `/cursor/iterate/async`)
- [ ] Set proper HTTP headers (`Content-Type: application/json`, `Accept: application/json`)
- [ ] Handle connection errors (ConnectionError)
- [ ] Handle timeout errors (TimeoutError)
- [ ] Handle HTTP error responses (non-2xx, except 422)
- [ ] Treat 422 Unprocessable Entity as valid response (not an error)
- [ ] Parse JSON response body
- [ ] Handle JSON parsing errors (InvalidResponseError)
- [ ] Return parsed response object
- [ ] Add appropriate logging (request and response logging)
- [ ] Write unit tests for the method
- [ ] Test with all parameters provided
- [ ] Test with optional `maxIterations` omitted (should default to 25)
- [ ] Test with optional `requestId` omitted (should auto-generate)
- [ ] Test with optional `callbackUrl` omitted (should not be in request body)
- [ ] Test with `callbackUrl` provided (should be in request body)
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios (connection errors, timeouts, HTTP errors, JSON parse errors)
- [ ] Test 422 response handling (should not throw error)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 5. CursorRunnerService Conversion
- The method uses a private `post` helper method in Rails - ensure similar helper is available or implement HTTP request directly
- The method uses a private `parse_response` helper method in Rails - ensure similar helper is available or implement JSON parsing directly
- The method uses a private `generate_request_id` helper method in Rails - implement this helper or inline the logic
- Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb` lines 51-66 for exact behavior
- The Rails implementation uses `SecureRandom.hex(4)` for random hex generation
- The Rails implementation uses `Time.now.to_i` for Unix timestamp
- The Rails implementation conditionally adds `callbackUrl` to the body only if `callback_url.present?` (i.e., if it's not nil/empty)
- The endpoint is `/cursor/iterate`, NOT `/cursor/iterate/async` as mentioned in some other documentation
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

- Next: PHASE2-032

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
