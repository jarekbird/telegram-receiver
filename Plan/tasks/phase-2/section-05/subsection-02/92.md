# PHASE2-029: Implement HTTP client utilities

**Section**: 5. CursorRunnerService Conversion
**Subsection**: 5.2
**Task ID**: PHASE2-029

## Description

Convert and implement HTTP client utilities from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb`.

These utilities provide the low-level HTTP communication layer for the CursorRunnerService, handling GET and POST requests, error handling, timeouts, and response parsing.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create private `get` method
  - Builds URI from base_url + path
  - Sets Content-Type and Accept headers to 'application/json'
  - Uses `buildHttp` to create HTTP client
  - Uses `executeRequest` to perform the request
  - Returns HTTP response

- [ ] Create private `post` method
  - Builds URI from base_url + path
  - Sets Content-Type and Accept headers to 'application/json'
  - Converts body to JSON string
  - Uses `buildHttp` to create HTTP client
  - Uses `executeRequest` to perform the request
  - Returns HTTP response

- [ ] Create `buildHttp` utility method
  - Creates HTTP client instance (using Node.js http/https modules or axios)
  - Configures SSL/TLS based on URI scheme (http vs https)
  - Sets read_timeout and open_timeout from service configuration (both use the same timeout value)
  - Handles connection errors (ECONNREFUSED, EHOSTUNREACH, SocketError) and raises ConnectionError with message: "Failed to connect to cursor-runner: {error.message}"
  - Handles timeout errors (OpenTimeout, ReadTimeout) and raises TimeoutError with message: "Request to cursor-runner timed out: {error.message}"
  - Returns configured HTTP client

- [ ] Create `executeRequest` utility method
  - Logs request method and path (e.g., "CursorRunnerService: GET /cursor/execute")
  - Executes the HTTP request
  - Logs response status code and message (e.g., "CursorRunnerService: Response 200 OK")
  - Handles 422 Unprocessable Entity as a valid response (allows caller to receive error details)
  - Raises Error (CursorRunnerServiceError) for non-success HTTP status codes (except 422)
  - Error message format: "HTTP {statusCode}: {statusMessage}" or extract from response body JSON if available (check for 'error' field)
  - Handles timeout errors (OpenTimeout, ReadTimeout) and raises TimeoutError with message: "Request to cursor-runner timed out: {error.message}"
  - Handles connection errors (ECONNREFUSED, EHOSTUNREACH, SocketError) and raises ConnectionError with message: "Failed to connect to cursor-runner: {error.message}"
  - Returns HTTP response

- [ ] Create `parseResponse` utility method
  - Parses JSON response body (response.body)
  - Handles JSON parsing errors and raises InvalidResponseError with message: "Failed to parse response: {error.message}"
  - Returns parsed object (plain JavaScript/TypeScript object, equivalent to Rails symbolize_names: true)

- [ ] Implement custom error classes
  - `CursorRunnerServiceError` (base error class)
  - `ConnectionError` (extends base error)
  - `TimeoutError` (extends base error)
  - `InvalidResponseError` (extends base error)

- [ ] Add timeout handling
  - Configure read_timeout and open_timeout on HTTP client (both use the same timeout value from service configuration)
  - Catch and handle timeout exceptions in both `buildHttp` and `executeRequest` methods
  - Raise TimeoutError with message: "Request to cursor-runner timed out: {error.message}"

- [ ] Add connection error handling
  - Catch connection refused errors (ECONNREFUSED)
  - Catch host unreachable errors (EHOSTUNREACH)
  - Catch socket errors (SocketError)
  - Handle in both `buildHttp` and `executeRequest` methods
  - Raise ConnectionError with message: "Failed to connect to cursor-runner: {error.message}"

- [ ] Add HTTP status code handling
  - Treat 422 Unprocessable Entity as valid response (return response, don't raise error)
  - Raise Error (CursorRunnerServiceError) for other non-success status codes (non-2xx, except 422)
  - Error message format: "HTTP {statusCode}: {statusMessage}"
  - Attempt to extract error message from response body JSON if available (check for 'error' field, fallback to default message)

- [ ] Add request logging
  - Log request method and path before execution
  - Log response status code and message after execution

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 5. CursorRunnerService Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation in `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb` for exact behavior
- These are private utility methods used by the public API methods (execute, iterate, etc.)
- Use Node.js built-in `http` and `https` modules or a library like `axios` or `node-fetch`
  - Note: PHASE2-028 specified using `axios` (already in package.json), so prefer `axios` for consistency
- Ensure error messages match the Rails implementation exactly for consistency:
  - ConnectionError: "Failed to connect to cursor-runner: {error.message}"
  - TimeoutError: "Request to cursor-runner timed out: {error.message}"
  - InvalidResponseError: "Failed to parse response: {error.message}"
  - HTTP Error: "HTTP {statusCode}: {statusMessage}" or response body 'error' field if available
- The 422 status code handling is important - it allows the caller to receive error details in the response body

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

- Next: PHASE2-030

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
