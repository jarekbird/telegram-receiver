# PHASE2-032: Implement clone_repository method

**Section**: 5. CursorRunnerService Conversion
**Subsection**: 5.5
**Task ID**: PHASE2-032

## Description

Convert the `clone_repository` method from Rails CursorRunnerService to TypeScript/Node.js. This method clones a Git repository by calling the cursor-runner API's `/git/clone` endpoint.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb` (lines 73-79)

## Method Signature

```typescript
cloneRepository(params: {
  repositoryUrl: string;
  repositoryName?: string;
}): Promise<GitCloneResponse>
```

**Parameters**:

- `repositoryUrl` (required): Git repository URL to clone
- `repositoryName` (optional): Repository name (defaults to URL-based name if not provided)

**Return Type**: Promise resolving to `GitCloneResponse` (defined in PHASE2-002) with `success`, `repository`, `message`, etc.

## Implementation Details

### Request Body Structure

The method should POST to `/git/clone` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "repositoryUrl": "<repository_url>",
  "repositoryName": "<repository_name>"
}
```

**Important Notes**:

- The request body uses `repositoryUrl` (camelCase), not `repository_url` (snake_case)
- The request body uses `repositoryName` (camelCase), not `repository_name` (snake_case)
- The `repositoryName` field should only be included in the request body if it is provided (conditionally added)
- If `repositoryName` is not provided, only `repositoryUrl` should be sent in the request body

### Response Parsing

- Parse the JSON response body
- Return the parsed object with symbol keys (or equivalent TypeScript object)
- Handle JSON parsing errors appropriately

### Error Handling

The method should handle and potentially throw the following error types:

- **ConnectionError**: Failed to connect to cursor-runner (ECONNREFUSED, EHOSTUNREACH, SocketError)
- **TimeoutError**: Request timed out (OpenTimeout, ReadTimeout)
- **InvalidResponseError**: Failed to parse JSON response
- **Error**: HTTP error responses (non-2xx, non-422 status codes)
  - Note: 422 Unprocessable Entity should be treated as a valid response (operation failed but request was valid)

### HTTP Request Details

- Method: POST
- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Accept: `application/json`
- Use the base URL from configuration (cursor-runner URL)
- Use timeout from configuration (cursor-runner timeout)

## Checklist

- [ ] Import `GitCloneResponse` type from `src/types/cursor-runner.ts` (defined in PHASE2-002)
- [ ] Implement `cloneRepository` method with correct TypeScript signature
- [ ] Accept required parameter: `repositoryUrl`
- [ ] Accept optional `repositoryName` parameter
- [ ] Build request body with `repositoryUrl` (camelCase)
- [ ] Conditionally add `repositoryName` to request body only if provided
- [ ] Ensure `repositoryUrl` is sent as camelCase in request body
- [ ] Ensure `repositoryName` is sent as camelCase in request body (if provided)
- [ ] POST to `/git/clone` endpoint
- [ ] Set proper HTTP headers (`Content-Type: application/json`, `Accept: application/json`)
- [ ] Handle connection errors (ConnectionError)
- [ ] Handle timeout errors (TimeoutError)
- [ ] Handle HTTP error responses (non-2xx, except 422)
- [ ] Treat 422 Unprocessable Entity as valid response (not an error)
- [ ] Parse JSON response body
- [ ] Handle JSON parsing errors (InvalidResponseError)
- [ ] Return parsed response object (typed as `GitCloneResponse`)
- [ ] Note: Request and response logging is handled automatically by the `executeRequest` helper method from PHASE2-029 (logs "CursorRunnerService: POST /git/clone" and "CursorRunnerService: Response {code} {message}")
- [ ] Write unit tests for the method
- [ ] Test with only `repositoryUrl` provided (should not include `repositoryName` in request body)
- [ ] Test with both `repositoryUrl` and `repositoryName` provided (should include both in request body)
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios (connection errors, timeouts, HTTP errors, JSON parse errors)
- [ ] Test 422 response handling (should not throw error)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 5. CursorRunnerService Conversion
- **Helper Methods Available**: The `post` and `parseResponse` helper methods are available from PHASE2-029. Use these helpers rather than implementing HTTP requests directly.
- **Type Definitions**: Use `GitCloneResponse` type from `src/types/cursor-runner.ts` (defined in PHASE2-002)
- **Logging**: Request and response logging is handled automatically by the `executeRequest` helper method from PHASE2-029 (logs "CursorRunnerService: POST /git/clone" and "CursorRunnerService: Response {code} {message}")
- Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb` lines 73-79 for exact behavior
- The Rails implementation conditionally adds `repositoryName` to the body only if `repository_name` is provided (i.e., if it's not nil)
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
