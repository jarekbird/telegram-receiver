# PHASE2-033: Implement list_repositories method

**Section**: 5. CursorRunnerService Conversion
**Subsection**: 5.6
**Task ID**: PHASE2-033

## Description

Convert the `list_repositories` method from Rails CursorRunnerService to TypeScript/Node.js. This method lists all locally cloned Git repositories by calling the cursor-runner API's `/git/repositories` endpoint.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb` (lines 81-86)

## Method Signature

```typescript
listRepositories(): Promise<GitListRepositoriesResponse>
```

**Parameters**: None

**Return Type**: Promise resolving to a `GitListRepositoriesResponse` object with `success` (boolean), `repositories` (string[] - array of repository name strings), and `count` (number).

## Implementation Details

### Request Details

The method should make a GET request to `/git/repositories` endpoint with no request body.

### Response Parsing

- Parse the JSON response body
- Return the parsed object matching the `GitListRepositoriesResponse` interface (defined in PHASE2-002)
- Handle JSON parsing errors appropriately
- The response should include:
  - `success`: boolean indicating if the request was successful
  - `repositories`: array of repository name strings (string[]), not objects
  - `count`: number of repositories (may be included)

### Error Handling

The method should handle and potentially throw the following error types:

- **ConnectionError**: Failed to connect to cursor-runner (ECONNREFUSED, EHOSTUNREACH, SocketError)
- **TimeoutError**: Request timed out (OpenTimeout, ReadTimeout)
- **InvalidResponseError**: Failed to parse JSON response
- **Error**: HTTP error responses (non-2xx, non-422 status codes)
  - Note: 422 Unprocessable Entity should be treated as a valid response (operation failed but request was valid)

### HTTP Request Details

- Method: GET
- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Accept: `application/json`
- Use the base URL from configuration (cursor-runner URL)
- Use timeout from configuration (cursor-runner timeout)
- No request body required

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `listRepositories` method with correct TypeScript signature
- [ ] Method takes no parameters
- [ ] GET to `/git/repositories` endpoint
- [ ] Set proper HTTP headers (`Content-Type: application/json`, `Accept: application/json`)
- [ ] Handle connection errors (ConnectionError)
- [ ] Handle timeout errors (TimeoutError)
- [ ] Handle HTTP error responses (non-2xx, except 422)
- [ ] Treat 422 Unprocessable Entity as valid response (not an error)
- [ ] Parse JSON response body
- [ ] Handle JSON parsing errors (InvalidResponseError)
- [ ] Return parsed response object matching `GitListRepositoriesResponse` type (success, repositories string array, and count)
- [ ] Add appropriate logging (request and response logging)
- [ ] Write unit tests for the method
- [ ] Test successful response parsing
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios (connection errors, timeouts, HTTP errors, JSON parse errors)
- [ ] Test 422 response handling (should not throw error)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 5. CursorRunnerService Conversion
- The `GitListRepositoriesResponse` type is defined in PHASE2-002 (`src/types/cursor-runner.ts`)
- Import the type from the cursor-runner types module: `import { GitListRepositoriesResponse } from '../types/cursor-runner'`
- The method uses a private `get` helper method in Rails - ensure similar helper is available or implement HTTP request directly
- The method uses a private `parse_response` helper method in Rails - ensure similar helper is available or implement JSON parsing directly
- Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb` lines 81-86 for exact behavior
- This is a GET request (no request body), unlike other methods that use POST
- The `repositories` field is an array of strings (repository names), not an array of objects
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
