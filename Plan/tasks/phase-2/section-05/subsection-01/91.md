# PHASE2-028: Create CursorRunnerService class structure

**Section**: 5. CursorRunnerService Conversion
**Subsection**: 5.1
**Task ID**: PHASE2-028

## Description

Create the CursorRunnerService class structure in TypeScript/Node.js. This service handles HTTP communication with the cursor-runner API for cursor execution and git operations. This task focuses on creating the basic class structure, constructor, and error classes only - method implementations will be added in subsequent tasks.

Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb` for the complete service structure and behavior.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/services/cursorRunnerService.ts` file (use camelCase naming per TypeScript conventions)
- [ ] Define `CursorRunnerService` class structure
- [ ] Add constructor with optional `baseUrl` and `timeout` parameters that default to application config values
  - Constructor should accept: `constructor(baseUrl?: string, timeout?: number)`
  - Default `baseUrl` should come from application config (e.g., `process.env.CURSOR_RUNNER_URL` or config module)
  - Default `timeout` should come from application config (e.g., `process.env.CURSOR_RUNNER_TIMEOUT` or config module)
- [ ] Import required types and dependencies:
  - HTTP client: `axios` (already in package.json)
  - JSON parsing: Built-in `JSON` (no import needed)
  - UUID generation: `crypto` module for generating request IDs (similar to Rails `SecureRandom`)
- [ ] Add custom error classes matching Rails implementation (as separate exported classes, not nested):
  - `CursorRunnerServiceError` (base error class, extends `Error`)
  - `ConnectionError` (extends `CursorRunnerServiceError` - for connection failures)
  - `TimeoutError` (extends `CursorRunnerServiceError` - for request timeouts)
  - `InvalidResponseError` (extends `CursorRunnerServiceError` - for JSON parsing errors)
  - Note: In TypeScript, these should be exported as separate classes, not nested classes like in Ruby

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 5. CursorRunnerService Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation for behavior

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
