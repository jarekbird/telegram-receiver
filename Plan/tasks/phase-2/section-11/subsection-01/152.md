# PHASE2-089: Create routes directory structure

**Section**: 11. Routes Configuration
**Subsection**: 11.1
**Task ID**: PHASE2-089

## Description

Create the routes directory structure and route files for the Express.js application, converting from Rails routes configuration. This task establishes the routing foundation that maps HTTP endpoints to controller handlers.

Reference `jarek-va/config/routes.rb` for the complete route definitions. The Rails application defines the following route groups:

1. **Health routes**: `GET /health` and `GET /` (root)
2. **Agent tools route**: `POST /agent-tools`
3. **Cursor-runner routes**: Multiple endpoints under `/cursor-runner` scope
4. **Telegram routes**: Multiple endpoints under `/telegram` scope
5. **Sidekiq Web UI**: `GET /sidekiq/*` - Background job monitoring UI (Ruby-specific, may need Node.js equivalent like BullMQ dashboard)

## Rails Routes Reference

From `jarek-va/config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
# Health check endpoint
get 'health', to: 'health#show'
root 'health#show'

# Agent tools webhook endpoint
post 'agent-tools', to: 'agent_tools#create'

# cursor-runner API endpoints
scope path: 'cursor-runner', as: 'cursor_runner' do
  post 'cursor/execute', to: 'cursor_runner#execute'
  post 'cursor/iterate', to: 'cursor_runner#iterate'
  post 'callback', to: 'cursor_runner_callback#create'
  post 'git/clone', to: 'cursor_runner#clone'
  get 'git/repositories', to: 'cursor_runner#repositories'
  post 'git/checkout', to: 'cursor_runner#checkout'
  post 'git/push', to: 'cursor_runner#push'
  post 'git/pull', to: 'cursor_runner#pull'
end

# Telegram webhook endpoints
scope path: 'telegram', as: 'telegram' do
  post 'webhook', to: 'telegram#webhook'
  post 'set_webhook', to: 'telegram#set_webhook'
  get 'webhook_info', to: 'telegram#webhook_info'
  delete 'webhook', to: 'telegram#delete_webhook'
end

# Sidekiq Web UI (mount in development/staging only, protect in production)
require 'sidekiq/web'
mount Sidekiq::Web => '/sidekiq'
```

## Checklist

### Directory Structure

- [ ] Verify `src/routes` directory exists (should already exist)
- [ ] Create `src/routes/index.ts` - Main route aggregator that imports and mounts all route modules
- [ ] Create `src/routes/health.routes.ts` - Health check routes (`GET /health`, `GET /`)
- [ ] Create `src/routes/agent-tools.routes.ts` - Agent tools webhook route (`POST /agent-tools`)
- [ ] Create `src/routes/cursor-runner.routes.ts` - Cursor runner API routes (`/cursor-runner/*`)
- [ ] Create `src/routes/telegram.routes.ts` - Telegram webhook routes (`/telegram/*`)
- [ ] Consider creating `src/routes/jobs.routes.ts` - Background job monitoring UI routes (`/sidekiq/*` or equivalent) - Note: Sidekiq is Ruby-specific; Node.js equivalent (e.g., BullMQ dashboard) should be implemented in a separate task

### Route File Structure

- [ ] Each route file should export an Express Router instance
- [ ] Use Express Router for route grouping and organization
- [ ] Routes should import their corresponding controller handlers (controllers will be created in later tasks)
- [ ] Route files should be structured to accept controller instances or factory functions

### Health Routes (`src/routes/health.routes.ts`)

- [ ] `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- [ ] `GET /` - Root endpoint (maps to health check)

### Agent Tools Routes (`src/routes/agent-tools.routes.ts`)

- [ ] `POST /agent-tools` - Agent tools webhook endpoint
- [ ] Include authentication middleware (webhook secret validation)
- [ ] Reference: `jarek-va/app/controllers/agent_tools_controller.rb`

### Cursor Runner Routes (`src/routes/cursor-runner.routes.ts`)

- [ ] `POST /cursor-runner/cursor/execute` - Execute cursor command
- [ ] `POST /cursor-runner/cursor/iterate` - Iterate cursor command
- [ ] `POST /cursor-runner/callback` - Callback from cursor-runner
- [ ] `POST /cursor-runner/git/clone` - Clone repository
- [ ] `GET /cursor-runner/git/repositories` - List repositories
- [ ] `POST /cursor-runner/git/checkout` - Checkout branch
- [ ] `POST /cursor-runner/git/push` - Push branch
- [ ] `POST /cursor-runner/git/pull` - Pull branch
- [ ] Include authentication middleware for callback endpoint (webhook secret)
- [ ] Reference: `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_controller.rb` and `cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb`

### Telegram Routes (`src/routes/telegram.routes.ts`)

- [ ] `POST /telegram/webhook` - Telegram webhook endpoint (requires webhook secret authentication)
- [ ] `POST /telegram/set_webhook` - Set webhook (admin only, requires admin secret)
- [ ] `GET /telegram/webhook_info` - Get webhook info (admin only, requires admin secret)
- [ ] `DELETE /telegram/webhook` - Delete webhook (admin only, requires admin secret)
- [ ] Include appropriate authentication middleware for each endpoint
- [ ] Reference: `jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb`

### Main Routes Index (`src/routes/index.ts`)

- [ ] Import all route modules
- [ ] Mount routes with appropriate path prefixes:
  - Health routes at root level
  - Agent tools routes at `/agent-tools`
  - Cursor runner routes at `/cursor-runner`
  - Telegram routes at `/telegram`
  - Background job monitoring UI routes at `/sidekiq` (or equivalent path for Node.js job queue dashboard) - Optional, may be implemented in a separate task
- [ ] Export a function that accepts Express app instance and mounts all routes
- [ ] Export individual route routers for testing purposes

### Route Organization

- [ ] Routes should be organized by feature/domain (health, agent-tools, cursor-runner, telegram)
- [ ] Each route file should be self-contained with its own router
- [ ] Route handlers should reference controller methods (to be implemented in later tasks)
- [ ] Use TypeScript types for route handlers (Express Request/Response types)

### Authentication Middleware Notes

- [ ] Webhook secret authentication: `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header (for Telegram webhook)
- [ ] Admin secret authentication: `X-Admin-Secret` header (for admin endpoints)
- [ ] Cursor runner callback authentication: `X-Webhook-Secret` or `X-Cursor-Runner-Secret` header
- [ ] Agent tools authentication: `X-EL-Secret` or `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- [ ] Middleware will be implemented in later tasks, but routes should be structured to accept middleware

## Implementation Notes

### Express Router Pattern

Each route file should follow this pattern:

```typescript
import { Router } from 'express';
import { HealthController } from '../controllers/health.controller';

const router = Router();
const healthController = new HealthController();

router.get('/health', healthController.show.bind(healthController));
router.get('/', healthController.show.bind(healthController));

export default router;
```

### Route Mounting in Main App

The main routes index should mount routes like:

```typescript
import { Express } from 'express';
import healthRoutes from './health.routes';
import agentToolsRoutes from './agent-tools.routes';
import cursorRunnerRoutes from './cursor-runner.routes';
import telegramRoutes from './telegram.routes';

export function setupRoutes(app: Express): void {
  app.use('/', healthRoutes);
  app.use('/agent-tools', agentToolsRoutes);
  app.use('/cursor-runner', cursorRunnerRoutes);
  app.use('/telegram', telegramRoutes);
}

export { healthRoutes, agentToolsRoutes, cursorRunnerRoutes, telegramRoutes };
```

### Controller References

- Controllers will be created in later tasks, so route files should import controller classes/types
- Use placeholder controller imports or comment out controller usage until controllers are implemented
- Route structure should be complete even if controllers are not yet available

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 11. Routes Configuration
- Reference the Rails implementation (`jarek-va/config/routes.rb`) for exact route definitions
- Controllers will be implemented in later tasks, so routes may reference controllers that don't exist yet
- Authentication middleware will be implemented separately - routes should be structured to accept middleware
- **Sidekiq Web UI**: The Rails application mounts Sidekiq Web UI at `/sidekiq`. Since Sidekiq is Ruby-specific, the Node.js version should use an equivalent background job monitoring solution (e.g., BullMQ dashboard). This route may be implemented in a separate task focused on background job infrastructure.
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
