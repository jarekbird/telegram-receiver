# PHASE2-008: Create Redis client configuration

**Section**: 2. Redis Integration
**Subsection**: 2.2
**Task ID**: PHASE2-008

## Description

Create Redis client configuration module that exports Redis connection settings. This configuration will be used by the Redis connection utility (PHASE2-009) and other services that need Redis connectivity.

**Rails Implementation Reference:**

- `config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq Redis configuration uses `ENV.fetch('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379/0')`
- `app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb` - Direct Redis client initialization uses `ENV.fetch('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379/0')`
- Default Redis URL: `redis://localhost:6379/0`
- In Docker: `REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0` (shared Redis instance)

**Node.js Implementation:**

- This task creates a configuration module that exports Redis connection settings
- The actual Redis client creation will be done in PHASE2-009 (Redis connection utility)
- Configuration should support both `redis` and `ioredis` packages (both are available in package.json)
- Use TypeScript types for type safety

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/config/redis.ts` file
- [ ] Access `process.env` (global in Node.js) for environment variable access
- [ ] Define `REDIS_URL` constant using `process.env.REDIS_URL` with default fallback to `'redis://localhost:6379/0'`
- [ ] Export Redis connection configuration object with:
  - [ ] `url` property (the Redis connection URL)
  - [ ] Optional connection options object (for future extensibility)
- [ ] Add TypeScript type definitions for the configuration object
- [ ] Export configuration as named export (e.g., `redisConfig`)
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments documenting the configuration structure
- [ ] Ensure configuration matches Rails pattern (environment variable with default)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 2. Redis Integration
- **Rails Files to Reference:**
  - `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq Redis configuration pattern
  - `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb` - Direct Redis client initialization pattern
- This task creates configuration only - actual Redis client creation is handled in PHASE2-009
- The configuration should be environment-aware (supports Docker and local development)
- Default URL matches Rails default: `redis://localhost:6379/0`
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
