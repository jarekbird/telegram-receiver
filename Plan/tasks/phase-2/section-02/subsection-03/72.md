# PHASE2-009: Create Redis connection utility

**Section**: 2. Redis Integration
**Subsection**: 2.3
**Task ID**: PHASE2-009

## Description

Create a Redis connection utility that provides a singleton Redis client instance for use throughout the application. This utility centralizes Redis client creation and provides a consistent interface for Redis connectivity.

**Rails Implementation Reference:**

- `app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb` - Shows Redis client initialization pattern:
  - Uses `Redis.new(url: redis_url)` to create client
  - Supports dependency injection (can pass `redis_client` or `redis_url`)
  - Falls back to `ENV.fetch('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379/0')`
  - In Docker: `REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0` (shared Redis instance)
  - Local development: Falls back to `redis://localhost:6379/0`

**Node.js Implementation:**

- Use `ioredis` package (already in dependencies, used for direct Redis operations)
- Implement singleton pattern to ensure single Redis connection instance
- Use Redis configuration from `src/config/redis.ts` (created in PHASE2-008)
- Support dependency injection for testing (allow passing mock Redis client)
- Basic error handling (connection errors, initialization errors)
- Advanced error handling (reconnection logic, event listeners) will be added in PHASE2-010

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/utils/redis.ts` file
- [ ] Import `Redis` from `ioredis` package
- [ ] Import `redisConfig` from `src/config/redis.ts` (PHASE2-008)
- [ ] Implement singleton pattern:
  - [ ] Create private `redisClient` variable (null initially)
  - [ ] Create `getRedisClient()` function that returns singleton instance
  - [ ] Initialize client on first access using `redisConfig.url`
  - [ ] Return existing client on subsequent calls
- [ ] Support dependency injection:
  - [ ] Add optional parameter to `getRedisClient()` to allow passing custom Redis client (for testing)
  - [ ] If custom client provided, use it instead of creating new instance
  - [ ] This matches Rails pattern where `redis_client` parameter takes precedence over `redis_url`
- [ ] Add basic error handling:
  - [ ] Wrap client initialization in try-catch
  - [ ] Log initialization errors
  - [ ] Throw meaningful errors if initialization fails
- [ ] Export `getRedisClient()` function as default export
- [ ] Add TypeScript type definitions:
  - [ ] Import `Redis` type from `ioredis`
  - [ ] Type the return value of `getRedisClient()`
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments documenting:
  - [ ] Singleton behavior
  - [ ] Dependency injection support
  - [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Ensure implementation matches Rails pattern (environment variable with default, dependency injection support)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 2. Redis Integration
- **Rails Files to Reference:**
  - `jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb` - Redis client initialization pattern (lines 15-21)
- **Dependencies:**
  - Requires PHASE2-008 (Redis configuration) to be completed first
  - Uses `ioredis` package (already in package.json dependencies)
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Singleton pattern ensures single Redis connection instance across the application
  - Dependency injection support allows passing mock clients in tests
  - Basic error handling covers initialization failures
  - Advanced error handling (reconnection, event listeners) is handled in PHASE2-010
- **Default Redis URL:** `redis://localhost:6379/0` (matches Rails default)
- **Docker Redis URL:** `redis://redis:6379/0` (set via REDIS_URL environment variable)
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent (after PHASE2-008 is complete)

## Related Tasks

- Previous: PHASE2-008
- Next: PHASE2-010

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
