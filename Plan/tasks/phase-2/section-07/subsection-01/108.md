# PHASE2-045: Create ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService class structure

**Section**: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
**Subsection**: 7.1
**Task ID**: PHASE2-045

## Description

Create the ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService class structure from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This task focuses on setting up the class skeleton including error classes, constants, constructor, and private properties. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb` for the complete implementation.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/services/elevenlabs-speech-to-text-service.ts` file
- [ ] Define `ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService` class structure
- [ ] Add custom error classes (5 total):
  - [ ] `Error` (base error class extending Error)
  - [ ] `ConnectionError` (extends Error)
  - [ ] `TimeoutError` (extends Error)
  - [ ] `InvalidResponseError` (extends Error)
  - [ ] `TranscriptionError` (extends Error)
- [ ] Define API constants (4 total):
  - [ ] `API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.elevenlabs.io'`
  - [ ] `TRANSCRIPTION_ENDPOINT = '/v1/speech-to-text'`
  - [ ] `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 60` (seconds)
  - [ ] `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID = 'scribe_v1'`
- [ ] Add constructor with parameters:
  - [ ] `api_key?: string` (optional, should read from config if not provided)
  - [ ] `timeout?: number` (optional, defaults to DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)
  - [ ] `model_id?: string` (optional, should read from config or default to DEFAULT_MODEL_ID)
  - [ ] Validate that `api_key` is not blank/empty (throw Error if missing)
- [ ] Add private properties:
  - [ ] `private readonly apiKey: string`
  - [ ] `private readonly timeout: number`
  - [ ] `private readonly modelId: string`
- [ ] Add getter methods or accessors for private properties (if needed)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
- Reference the Rails implementation at `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb` for behavior
- The constructor should read configuration values from the application config (similar to `Rails.application.config.elevenlabs_api_key` in Rails)
- In TypeScript/Node.js, use environment variables or a config service for API key and model ID
- This task only creates the class structure - method implementations will be added in subsequent tasks (PHASE2-046, PHASE2-047, etc.)
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
