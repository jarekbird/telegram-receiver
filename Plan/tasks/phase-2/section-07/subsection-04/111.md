# PHASE2-048: Add error handling to SpeechToTextService

**Section**: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
**Subsection**: 7.4
**Task ID**: PHASE2-048

## Description

Add comprehensive error handling to the ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService class methods, matching the error handling patterns from the Rails implementation. This task ensures all methods properly handle network errors, timeouts, invalid responses, and transcription failures with appropriate error classes and logging. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb` for the complete error handling implementation.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb`

## Checklist

### Error Handling in `build_http` method (private)

- [ ] Catch `ECONNREFUSED`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, and `SocketError` exceptions
- [ ] Raise `ConnectionError` with message "Failed to connect to ElevenLabs: {error message}"
- [ ] Catch `Net::OpenTimeout` and `Net::ReadTimeout` exceptions
- [ ] Raise `TimeoutError` with message "Request to ElevenLabs timed out: {error message}"

### Error Handling in `execute_request` method (private)

- [ ] Log request info: "ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService: POST {uri.path}"
- [ ] Log response info: "ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService: Response {code} {message}"
- [ ] Check if response is not successful (non-2xx status)
- [ ] Extract error message from response body (try JSON parsing)
- [ ] Log error: "ElevenLabs API error: {code} - Response body: {body[0..500]}"
- [ ] Parse error response JSON to extract detail/error/message fields
- [ ] Log JSON parse failure if error response cannot be parsed: "Failed to parse error response as JSON"
- [ ] Raise `TranscriptionError` with extracted error message for non-2xx responses
- [ ] Catch `Net::OpenTimeout` and `Net::ReadTimeout` exceptions
- [ ] Raise `TimeoutError` with message "Request to ElevenLabs timed out: {error message}"
- [ ] Catch `ECONNREFUSED`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, and `SocketError` exceptions

### Error Handling in `parse_response` method (private)

- [ ] Catch `JSON::ParserError` exceptions
- [ ] Raise `InvalidResponseError` with message "Failed to parse response: {error message}"

### Error Handling in `transcribe` method (public)

- [ ] Catch `Errno::ENOENT` (file not found) exceptions
- [ ] Raise base `Error` with message "Audio file not found: {error message}"

### Logging Requirements

- [ ] Log info when sending audio file: "Sending audio file to ElevenLabs for transcription: {file_path}"
- [ ] Log info when sending audio IO: "Sending audio IO to ElevenLabs for transcription: {filename}"
- [ ] Log info on successful transcription: "Successfully transcribed audio: {text[0..50]}..."
- [ ] Log error for API errors with response code and body preview
- [ ] Log error when JSON parsing fails for error responses

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
- **Rails Implementation**: `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb` (lines 109-155 for private methods, lines 32-66 and 73-103 for public methods)
- Error classes (Error, ConnectionError, TimeoutError, InvalidResponseError, TranscriptionError) should already be defined from PHASE2-045
- This task adds error handling to methods that should already be implemented (transcribe from PHASE2-046, transcribe_io from PHASE2-047)
- Error handling should be integrated into existing method implementations, not added as separate methods
- **Error Propagation**: Connection and timeout errors from `build_http` and `execute_request` will naturally propagate to the public methods (`transcribe` and `transcribe_io`) without needing explicit catch blocks in those methods. Only specific errors (like `Errno::ENOENT` for file operations and `JSON::ParserError` from `parse_response`) need explicit handling in the public methods.
- In TypeScript/Node.js, equivalent error types:
  - `ECONNREFUSED`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, `SocketError` → Network connection errors (use appropriate Node.js error types like `ECONNREFUSED`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, or generic `Error` with appropriate error codes)
  - `Net::OpenTimeout`, `Net::ReadTimeout` → Request timeout errors (use fetch/axios timeout handling or AbortController with timeout)
  - `JSON::ParserError` → JSON parsing errors (use try-catch around JSON.parse)
  - `Errno::ENOENT` → File not found errors (use fs.access or fs.stat with error handling, or catch `ENOENT` error code)
- Logging should use the application's logger (similar to Rails.logger)
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
