# PHASE2-046: Implement transcribe method (file path)

**Section**: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
**Subsection**: 7.2
**Task ID**: PHASE2-046

## Description

Convert the `transcribe` method (file path) from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This method transcribes an audio file to text using the ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text API.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb` (lines 32-66)

## Method Signature

```typescript
transcribe(audioFilePath: string, language?: string): Promise<string>
```

**Parameters**:

- `audioFilePath` (string, required): Path to the audio file to transcribe
- `language` (string, optional): Language code (e.g., 'en', 'es', 'fr')

**Returns**: Promise<string> - The transcribed text

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `transcribe` method with correct signature
- [ ] Validate `audioFilePath` parameter is not blank/null
- [ ] Validate file exists at the given path (throw error if not found)
- [ ] Read file content as binary data
- [ ] Extract filename from file path using basename
- [ ] Create multipart form data with:
  - [ ] File content with filename
  - [ ] `model_id` field (use configured model_id or default 'scribe_v1')
  - [ ] `language` field (only if language parameter is provided)
- [ ] Build HTTP POST request to `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text`
- [ ] Set `xi-api-key` header with API key
- [ ] Set `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`
- [ ] Execute HTTP request with timeout handling
- [ ] Parse JSON response
- [ ] Extract `text` field from response (handle both string and symbol keys)
- [ ] Validate transcribed text is not blank (throw error if blank)
- [ ] Return transcribed text string
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling:
  - [ ] Custom error classes: Error, ConnectionError, TimeoutError, InvalidResponseError, TranscriptionError
  - [ ] Handle file not found errors (ENOENT)
  - [ ] Handle JSON parsing errors
  - [ ] Handle HTTP error responses (non-2xx status codes):
    - [ ] Extract error message from response body JSON if available
    - [ ] Look for 'detail', 'error', or 'message' fields in error response
    - [ ] Fall back to HTTP status code and message if JSON parsing fails
    - [ ] Log error response body (first 500 characters) for debugging
  - [ ] Handle network connection errors
  - [ ] Handle timeout errors
- [ ] Add logging:
  - [ ] Log when sending audio file for transcription (include file path)
  - [ ] Log successful transcription (include first 50 characters of transcribed text)

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoint

- **URL**: `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text`
- **Method**: POST
- **Headers**:
  - `xi-api-key`: API key from configuration
  - `Content-Type`: `multipart/form-data`

### Form Data Fields

- `file`: Binary file content with filename
- `model_id`: Model ID (from config or default 'scribe_v1')
- `language`: Optional language code (only if provided)

### Response Format

The API returns JSON with a `text` field containing the transcribed text:

```json
{
  "text": "Transcribed text here"
}
```

### Error Handling

- Throw error if `audioFilePath` is blank/null
- Throw error if file doesn't exist
- Throw `TranscriptionError` if HTTP response is not successful (non-2xx):
  - Extract detailed error message from response body JSON if available
  - Check for 'detail', 'error', or 'message' fields in error response JSON
  - Fall back to HTTP status code and message if JSON parsing fails
  - Log error response body (first 500 characters) for debugging
- Throw `TranscriptionError` if transcribed text is blank
- Throw `InvalidResponseError` if JSON parsing fails
- Throw `ConnectionError` for network connection issues
- Throw `TimeoutError` for request timeouts
- Handle `ENOENT` errors when reading file

### File Reading

- Use binary file reading (equivalent to Ruby's `File.binread`)
- Extract filename from path using basename utility

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
- **Rails Implementation**: `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb`
- The method should be part of the `ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService` class
- The service should be initialized with API key, timeout, and model_id (handled in service initialization, not this method)
- Default model_id is 'scribe_v1' if not configured
- Default timeout is 60 seconds
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Related Tasks

- Previous: PHASE2-045
- Next: PHASE2-047

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
