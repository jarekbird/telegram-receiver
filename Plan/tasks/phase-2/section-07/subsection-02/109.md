# PHASE2-046: Implement transcribe method (file path)

**Section**: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
**Subsection**: 7.2
**Task ID**: PHASE2-046

## Description

Convert the `transcribe` method (file path) from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This method transcribes an audio file to text using the ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text API.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb` (lines 32-66)

## Method Signature

```typescript
transcribe(audioFilePath: string, language?: string): Promise<string>
```

**Parameters**:

- `audioFilePath` (string, required): Path to the audio file to transcribe
- `language` (string, optional): Language code (e.g., 'en', 'es', 'fr')

**Returns**: Promise<string> - The transcribed text

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `transcribe` method with correct signature
- [ ] Validate `audioFilePath` parameter is not blank/null
- [ ] Validate file exists at the given path (throw error if not found)
- [ ] Read file content as binary data
- [ ] Extract filename from file path using basename
- [ ] Create multipart form data with:
  - [ ] File content with filename
  - [ ] `model_id` field (use configured model_id or default 'scribe_v1')
  - [ ] `language` field (only if language parameter is provided)
- [ ] Build HTTP POST request to `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text`
- [ ] Set `xi-api-key` header with API key
- [ ] Set `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`
- [ ] Execute HTTP request with timeout handling
- [ ] Parse JSON response
- [ ] Extract `text` field from response (handle both string and symbol keys)
- [ ] Validate transcribed text is not blank (throw error if blank)
- [ ] Return transcribed text string
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling:
  - [ ] Custom error classes: Error, ConnectionError, TimeoutError, InvalidResponseError, TranscriptionError
  - [ ] Handle file not found errors (ENOENT)
  - [ ] Handle JSON parsing errors
  - [ ] Handle HTTP error responses (non-2xx status codes):
    - [ ] Extract error message from response body JSON if available
    - [ ] Look for 'detail', 'error', or 'message' fields in error response
    - [ ] Fall back to HTTP status code and message if JSON parsing fails
    - [ ] Log error response body (first 500 characters) for debugging
  - [ ] Handle network connection errors
  - [ ] Handle timeout errors
- [ ] Add logging:
  - [ ] Log when sending audio file for transcription (include file path)
  - [ ] Log successful transcription (include first 50 characters of transcribed text)

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoint

- **URL**: `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text`
- **Method**: POST
- **Headers**:
  - `xi-api-key`: API key from configuration
  - `Content-Type`: `multipart/form-data`

### Form Data Fields

- `file`: Binary file content with filename
- `model_id`: Model ID (from config or default 'scribe_v1')
- `language`: Optional language code (only if provided)

### Response Format

The API returns JSON with a `text` field containing the transcribed text:

```json
{
  "text": "Transcribed text here"
}
```

### Error Handling

- Throw error if `audioFilePath` is blank/null
- Throw error if file doesn't exist
- Throw `TranscriptionError` if HTTP response is not successful (non-2xx):
  - Extract detailed error message from response body JSON if available
  - Check for 'detail', 'error', or 'message' fields in error response JSON
  - Fall back to HTTP status code and message if JSON parsing fails
  - Log error response body (first 500 characters) for debugging
- Throw `TranscriptionError` if transcribed text is blank
- Throw `InvalidResponseError` if JSON parsing fails
- Throw `ConnectionError` for network connection issues
- Throw `TimeoutError` for request timeouts
- Handle `ENOENT` errors when reading file

### File Reading

- Use binary file reading (equivalent to Ruby's `File.binread`)
- Extract filename from path using basename utility

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
- **Rails Implementation**: `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb`
- The method should be part of the `ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService` class
- The service should be initialized with API key, timeout, and model_id (handled in service initialization, not this method)
- Default model_id is 'scribe_v1' if not configured
- Default timeout is 60 seconds
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
