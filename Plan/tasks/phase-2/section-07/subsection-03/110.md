# PHASE2-047: Implement transcribe_io method

**Section**: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
**Subsection**: 7.3
**Task ID**: PHASE2-047

## Description

Convert the `transcribe_io` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This method transcribes audio from an IO object (e.g., downloaded file stream) using the ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text API. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb` for the Rails implementation.

## Rails Implementation Reference

The `transcribe_io` method is located in `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb` (lines 73-103).

**Method Signature:**

```ruby
def transcribe_io(audio_io, filename: 'audio.ogg', language: nil)
```

**Key Implementation Details:**

- Accepts an IO object (`audio_io`), optional `filename` (default: 'audio.ogg'), and optional `language` parameter
- Validates that `audio_io` is not nil (raises `Error` if nil)
- Rewinds the IO object if it responds to `rewind` (to ensure reading from the beginning)
- Reads the IO content into memory
- Creates multipart form data with:
  - `file` field containing the audio content and filename
  - `model_id` field (uses instance variable `@model_id`)
  - `language` field (if provided)
- Sends POST request to `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text`
- Sets `xi-api-key` header with API key
- Sets `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`
- Validates HTTP response status - non-success responses raise `TranscriptionError` (not just validation)
- For error responses, attempts to parse error JSON and extract error message from `detail`, `error`, or `message` fields
- Parses JSON response and extracts transcribed text from `result['text']` or `result[:text]` (response uses symbolize_names: true)
- Validates that transcribed text is not blank (raises `TranscriptionError` if blank)
- Handles `JSON::ParserError` exceptions (raises `InvalidResponseError`)
- Handles timeout errors (`TimeoutError`) and connection errors (`ConnectionError`)
- Logs specific messages:
  - Info: "Sending audio IO to ElevenLabs for transcription: #{filename}"
  - Info: "ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService: POST #{uri.path}" (from execute_request)
  - Info: "ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService: Response #{response.code} #{response.message}" (from execute_request)
  - Info: "Successfully transcribed audio: #{transcribed_text[0..50]}..." (truncated to first 50 chars)
  - Error: "ElevenLabs API error: #{response.code} - Response body: #{response.body[0..500]}" (for non-success responses)

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `transcribeIo` method with signature: `transcribeIo(audioIo: NodeJS.ReadableStream | Buffer, options?: { filename?: string; language?: string }): Promise<string>`
- [ ] Validate that `audioIo` is not null/undefined
- [ ] Handle IO/stream rewinding if the stream supports it (for Node.js streams, may need to handle position reset)
- [ ] Read IO/stream content into memory (convert stream to Buffer)
- [ ] Create multipart form data with:
  - `file` field containing audio content and filename (default: 'audio.ogg')
  - `model_id` field (use instance `modelId` property)
  - `language` field (if provided in options)
- [ ] Send POST request to `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text`
- [ ] Set `xi-api-key` header with API key from instance
- [ ] Set `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`
- [ ] Validate HTTP response status (check for success status codes 2xx)
- [ ] For non-success responses, raise `TranscriptionError` (not just validate)
- [ ] For error responses, attempt to parse error JSON and extract error message from `detail`, `error`, or `message` fields
- [ ] Log error details for non-success responses (include response code and first 500 chars of response body)
- [ ] Parse JSON response body
- [ ] Extract transcribed text from response (`result.text` or `result['text']`)
- [ ] Validate that transcribed text is not blank (throw `TranscriptionError` if blank)
- [ ] Return transcribed text as string
- [ ] Handle JSON parsing errors (`InvalidResponseError`)
- [ ] Handle transcription errors (when no text is returned or HTTP response is not successful)
- [ ] Handle timeout errors (`TimeoutError`) - may be in helper methods
- [ ] Handle connection errors (`ConnectionError`) - may be in helper methods
- [ ] Add appropriate logging:
  - Info: "Sending audio IO to ElevenLabs for transcription: {filename}"
  - Info: "ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService: POST {uri.path}"
  - Info: "ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService: Response {code} {message}"
  - Info: "Successfully transcribed audio: {first 50 chars}..."
  - Error: "ElevenLabs API error: {code} - Response body: {first 500 chars}" (for non-success responses)

## Implementation Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
- The method should be part of the `ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService` class
- In Node.js, IO objects are typically `ReadableStream` or `Buffer` objects
- Use a multipart form library (e.g., `form-data` or `formidable`) for creating multipart requests
- The method should use the same error classes as other methods in the service (Error, ConnectionError, TimeoutError, InvalidResponseError, TranscriptionError)
- The method uses helper methods `build_http`, `execute_request`, and `parse_response` in the Rails implementation - these may be implemented as separate helper methods or inline in TypeScript
- HTTP timeout and connection error handling may be implemented in helper methods or using HTTP client library features
- Non-success HTTP responses (non-2xx) should raise `TranscriptionError`, not just validate
- Error responses from the API should be parsed to extract meaningful error messages from JSON fields (`detail`, `error`, or `message`)
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
