# PHASE2-047: Implement transcribe_io method

**Section**: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
**Subsection**: 7.3
**Task ID**: PHASE2-047

## Description

Convert the `transcribe_io` method from Rails to TypeScript/Node.js. This method transcribes audio from an IO object (e.g., downloaded file stream) using the ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text API. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb` for the Rails implementation.

## Rails Implementation Reference

The `transcribe_io` method is located in `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_speech_to_text_service.rb` (lines 73-103).

**Method Signature:**

```ruby
def transcribe_io(audio_io, filename: 'audio.ogg', language: nil)
```

**Key Implementation Details:**

- Accepts an IO object (`audio_io`), optional `filename` (default: 'audio.ogg'), and optional `language` parameter
- Validates that `audio_io` is not nil (raises `Error` if nil)
- Rewinds the IO object if it responds to `rewind` (to ensure reading from the beginning)
- Reads the IO content into memory
- Creates multipart form data with:
  - `file` field containing the audio content and filename
  - `model_id` field (uses instance variable `@model_id`)
  - `language` field (if provided)
- Sends POST request to `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text`
- Sets `xi-api-key` header with API key
- Sets `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`
- Validates HTTP response status - non-success responses raise `TranscriptionError` (not just validation)
- For error responses, attempts to parse error JSON and extract error message from `detail`, `error`, or `message` fields
- Parses JSON response and extracts transcribed text from `result['text']` or `result[:text]` (response uses symbolize_names: true)
- Validates that transcribed text is not blank (raises `TranscriptionError` if blank)
- Handles `JSON::ParserError` exceptions (raises `InvalidResponseError`)
- Handles timeout errors (`TimeoutError`) and connection errors (`ConnectionError`)
- Logs specific messages:
  - Info: "Sending audio IO to ElevenLabs for transcription: #{filename}"
  - Info: "ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService: POST #{uri.path}" (from execute_request)
  - Info: "ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService: Response #{response.code} #{response.message}" (from execute_request)
  - Info: "Successfully transcribed audio: #{transcribed_text[0..50]}..." (truncated to first 50 chars)
  - Error: "ElevenLabs API error: #{response.code} - Response body: #{response.body[0..500]}" (for non-success responses)

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `transcribeIo` method with signature: `transcribeIo(audioIo: NodeJS.ReadableStream | Buffer, options?: { filename?: string; language?: string }): Promise<string>`
- [ ] Validate that `audioIo` is not null/undefined
- [ ] Handle IO/stream rewinding if the stream supports it (for Node.js streams, may need to handle position reset)
- [ ] Read IO/stream content into memory (convert stream to Buffer)
- [ ] Create multipart form data with:
  - `file` field containing audio content and filename (default: 'audio.ogg')
  - `model_id` field (use instance `modelId` property)
  - `language` field (if provided in options)
- [ ] Send POST request to `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text`
- [ ] Set `xi-api-key` header with API key from instance
- [ ] Set `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`
- [ ] Validate HTTP response status (check for success status codes 2xx)
- [ ] For non-success responses, raise `TranscriptionError` (not just validate)
- [ ] For error responses, attempt to parse error JSON and extract error message from `detail`, `error`, or `message` fields
- [ ] Log error details for non-success responses (include response code and first 500 chars of response body)
- [ ] Parse JSON response body
- [ ] Extract transcribed text from response (`result.text` or `result['text']`)
- [ ] Validate that transcribed text is not blank (throw `TranscriptionError` if blank)
- [ ] Return transcribed text as string
- [ ] Handle JSON parsing errors (`InvalidResponseError`)
- [ ] Handle transcription errors (when no text is returned or HTTP response is not successful)
- [ ] Handle timeout errors (`TimeoutError`) - may be in helper methods
- [ ] Handle connection errors (`ConnectionError`) - may be in helper methods
- [ ] Add appropriate logging:
  - Info: "Sending audio IO to ElevenLabs for transcription: {filename}"
  - Info: "ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService: POST {uri.path}"
  - Info: "ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService: Response {code} {message}"
  - Info: "Successfully transcribed audio: {first 50 chars}..."
  - Error: "ElevenLabs API error: {code} - Response body: {first 500 chars}" (for non-success responses)

## Implementation Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
- The method should be part of the `ElevenLabsSpeechToTextService` class
- In Node.js, IO objects are typically `ReadableStream` or `Buffer` objects
- Use a multipart form library (e.g., `form-data` or `formidable`) for creating multipart requests
- The method should use the same error classes as other methods in the service (Error, ConnectionError, TimeoutError, InvalidResponseError, TranscriptionError)
- The method uses helper methods `build_http`, `execute_request`, and `parse_response` in the Rails implementation - these may be implemented as separate helper methods or inline in TypeScript
- HTTP timeout and connection error handling may be implemented in helper methods or using HTTP client library features
- Non-success HTTP responses (non-2xx) should raise `TranscriptionError`, not just validate
- Error responses from the API should be parsed to extract meaningful error messages from JSON fields (`detail`, `error`, or `message`)
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
