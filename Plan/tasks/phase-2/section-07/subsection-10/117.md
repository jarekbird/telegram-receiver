# PHASE2-054: Write TextToSpeechService unit tests

**Section**: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
**Subsection**: 7.10
**Task ID**: PHASE2-054

## Description

Write comprehensive unit tests for the ElevenLabsTextToSpeechService TypeScript implementation. The tests should cover all public methods, error handling scenarios, and edge cases. Reference `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_text_to_speech_service.rb` for the complete implementation details and behavior to test.

The service includes the following methods to test:

- Constructor/initialization (lines 23-30)
- `voiceIdConfigured` method (lines 32-34)
- `synthesize` method (lines 41-76)
- `synthesizeToIo` method (lines 82-110)

Error classes to test:

- `ElevenLabsTextToSpeechServiceError` (base error)
- `ConnectionError`
- `TimeoutError`
- `InvalidResponseError`
- `SynthesisError`

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 7. ElevenLabs Services Conversion
- **Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/services/eleven_labs_text_to_speech_service.rb`

### Implementation Details from Rails:

1. **Service Structure**:
   - Constructor validates API key is present (raises error if blank)
   - Uses default values from config or constants
   - Default timeout: 60 seconds
   - Default model_id: 'eleven_turbo_v2_5'
   - Default voice_id: 'vfaqCOvlrKi4Zp7C2IAm'
   - Default output_format: 'mp3_44100_128'

2. **synthesize Method** (lines 41-76):
   - Validates text is not blank
   - Validates voice_id is configured
   - Builds URI with voice_id in path
   - Creates temp file path if output_path not provided (uses SecureRandom.hex(8) for uniqueness)
   - Saves audio file to disk using File.binwrite
   - Returns file path string
   - Logs request info before sending (line 65: truncates text to 50 chars)
   - Logs file generation info after success (line 71: includes path and file size in bytes)

3. **synthesizeToIo Method** (lines 82-110):
   - Validates text is not blank
   - Validates voice_id is configured
   - Builds URI with voice_id in path
   - Returns Buffer (Node.js equivalent of StringIO)
   - Does not save file to disk
   - Logs request info before sending (line 103: truncates text to 50 chars)

4. **Error Handling** (see PHASE2-053 for details):
   - Connection errors: ECONNREFUSED, EHOSTUNREACH, ENOTFOUND (raised in build_http and execute_request)
   - Timeout errors: ETIMEDOUT, Net::OpenTimeout, Net::ReadTimeout (raised in build_http and execute_request)
   - HTTP errors: Non-200 status codes → SynthesisError (line 136)
   - JSON parsing errors: InvalidResponseError (lines 74-75, 108-109)
   - Error response parsing handles multiple formats (lines 142-156):
     - Array format: `[{msg: "error1"}, {msg: "error2"}]` → joins with '; '
     - Hash format: checks 'detail', 'error', 'message' fields
     - Nested array in detail: `{detail: [{msg: "error1"}]}` → extracts and joins
     - Falls back to default HTTP error message if JSON parsing fails
   - Error logging: logs response code, message, and truncated body (500 chars) on API errors (line 138)
   - Error logging: logs JSON parse failure for error responses (line 158)
   - Request/response logging: logs POST path (line 129) and response code/message (line 134)

5. **Testing Tools**:
   - Use `nock` for HTTP request mocking (already in devDependencies)
   - Use `jest` mocking for file system operations
   - Use `fs` module mocking for file write operations
   - Mock logger to verify log calls

6. **Test File Location**:
   - Should be in `tests/unit/services/` directory (not `tests/services/`)
   - Follow Jest test naming convention: `*.test.ts`

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- This task assumes the service implementation from PHASE2-050, PHASE2-051, PHASE2-052, and PHASE2-053 is already in place

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
