# PHASE2-016: Add async error handling

**Section**: 3. Async Processing Setup
**Subsection**: 3.5
**Task ID**: PHASE2-016

## Description

Add comprehensive async error handling for async operations, converting the error handling patterns from Rails Sidekiq to TypeScript/Node.js. This includes error handling utilities, retry logic configuration, operation failure handling, and comprehensive logging of async events.

**Rails Implementation Reference:**

- `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq error handling configuration:
  - Line 34-37: `Sidekiq.default_job_options = { retry: 3, backtrace: true }` - Default retry 3 times with backtraces
  - Line 31: `Sidekiq.logger.level = Logger::INFO` - Logging level configuration
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/application_job.rb` - Base job retry configuration:
  - Line 14: `retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 3` - Retry with exponential backoff
  - Line 17: `discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError` - Discard deserialization errors
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` - Job-level error handling:
  - Lines 32-50: Comprehensive error handling with logging and user notifications
  - Line 33-34: Error logging with backtraces
  - Line 50: Re-raising errors to mark job as failed

**Node.js Implementation:**

- Create `src/handlers/async-error-handler.ts` to provide centralized error handling for async operations
- Add error handling utilities for async operations
- Implement retry logic configuration matching Rails behavior (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
- Add operation failure handling for operations that exhaust all retries
- Implement comprehensive logging for all async events (errors, failures, retries, completions)
- This error handler will be used by all async handlers to ensure consistent error handling across the application

## Checklist

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 3. Async Processing Setup
- **Rails Files to Reference:**
  - `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq error handling:
    - Line 34-37: `Sidekiq.default_job_options = { retry: 3, backtrace: true }` - Default retry 3 times, include backtraces
    - Line 31: `Sidekiq.logger.level = Logger::INFO` - Logging level
  - `jarek-va/app/jobs/application_job.rb` - Base job retry:
    - Line 14: `retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 3` - Retry 3 times with exponential backoff
    - Line 17: `discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError` - Discard deserialization errors
  - `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` - Job error handling example:
    - Lines 32-50: Try-catch with error logging and user notification
    - Line 33-34: `Rails.logger.error` with error message and backtrace
    - Line 50: Re-raise error to mark job as failed
- **Dependencies:**
  - Requires async utilities (completed in PHASE2-014)
  - Requires async configuration (completed in PHASE2-013)
  - Requires base async handler (completed in PHASE2-015)
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Since we're not using a queue system, error handling is done at the async operation level
  - Error handling should wrap async operations with try-catch and retry logic
  - Retry configuration should use async utilities from `src/utils/async.ts`
  - Exponential backoff: Use `withRetry` utility with exponential backoff (from PHASE2-014)
  - Error handlers should be utility functions that can wrap async operations
  - The error handler should be a utility that can be imported and used by async handler code
  - Logging should use the application's logger utility (not console.log)
  - Error logs should include: timestamp, operation identifier, error message, stack trace, operation data (if available)
  - Failed operation handling should log but not throw (to prevent cascading failures)
  - Error classification: Some errors (like deserialization errors) should not be retried
- **Key Differences from Rails:**
  - Rails: Sidekiq handles retries automatically based on job class configuration
  - Node.js: Retry logic must be explicitly applied using async utilities
  - Rails: Error handling is in job class `perform` method
  - Node.js: Error handling can be at both handler level (PHASE2-015) and operation level (this task)
  - Rails: Sidekiq logs errors automatically with backtraces
  - Node.js: Must explicitly wrap operations and log errors
- **Usage Pattern:**
  - Import error handler: `import { withErrorHandling, defaultRetryOptions } from '@/handlers/async-error-handler'`
  - When calling async operations: `await withErrorHandling(() => someAsyncOperation(), { retries: 3 })`
  - When using handlers: `await withErrorHandling(() => handler.handle(data), defaultRetryOptions)`
- **Testing Considerations:**
  - Test error handling wrapper catches errors correctly
  - Test retry logic is applied correctly
  - Test failed operation handler logs failed operations correctly
  - Test logging includes all required information
  - Test error handlers don't throw (prevent cascading failures)
  - Test error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent (after PHASE2-013, PHASE2-014, and PHASE2-015 are complete)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
