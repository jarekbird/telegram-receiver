# PHASE2-016: Add async error handling

**Section**: 3. Async Processing Setup
**Subsection**: 3.5
**Task ID**: PHASE2-016

## Description

Add comprehensive async error handling for async operations, converting the error handling patterns from Rails Sidekiq to TypeScript/Node.js. This includes error handling utilities, retry logic configuration, operation failure handling, and comprehensive logging of async events.

**Rails Implementation Reference:**

- `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq error handling configuration:
  - Line 34-37: `Sidekiq.default_job_options = { retry: 3, backtrace: true }` - Default retry 3 times with backtraces
  - Line 31: `Sidekiq.logger.level = Logger::INFO` - Logging level configuration
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/application_job.rb` - Base job retry configuration:
  - Line 14: `retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 3` - Retry with exponential backoff
  - Line 17: `discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError` - Discard deserialization errors
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` - Job-level error handling:
  - Lines 32-50: Comprehensive error handling with logging and user notifications
  - Line 33-34: Error logging with backtraces
  - Line 50: Re-raising errors to mark job as failed

**Node.js Implementation:**

- Create `src/handlers/async-error-handler.ts` to provide centralized error handling for async operations
- Add error handling utilities for async operations
- Implement retry logic configuration matching Rails behavior (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
- Add operation failure handling for operations that exhaust all retries
- Implement comprehensive logging for all async events (errors, failures, retries, completions)
- This error handler will be used by all async handlers to ensure consistent error handling across the application

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/handlers/async-error-handler.ts` file
- [ ] Implement error handling utilities:
  - [ ] Add error handler wrapper for async operations
  - [ ] Add error classification (retryable vs non-retryable errors)
  - [ ] Add error logging with full stack traces (matching Rails `backtrace: true`)
  - [ ] Add operation failure handling for operations that exhaust all retries
  - [ ] Add operation completion logging (optional, can be configurable)
  - [ ] Add timeout error handling
- [ ] Implement retry logic configuration:
  - [ ] Configure default retry attempts: 3 (matching Rails `retry: 3`)
  - [ ] Configure exponential backoff delay (matching Rails `wait: :exponentially_longer`)
  - [ ] Set retry delay strategy: exponential with initial delay (e.g., 2000ms base delay)
  - [ ] Export retry configuration for use in async handler setup
- [ ] Add operation failure handling:
  - [ ] Handle operations that fail after all retries are exhausted
  - [ ] Log failed operations with full error details and backtraces (matching Rails `backtrace: true`)
  - [ ] Store failed operation information for debugging/monitoring
  - [ ] Optionally send notifications for critical failures
  - [ ] Ensure error handlers never throw errors themselves (prevent cascading failures)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging:
  - [ ] Log all error events with operation identifier, error message, and stack trace
  - [ ] Log operation failures with full context (attempts, error details, operation data)
  - [ ] Log operation completions for monitoring (optional, can be configurable)
  - [ ] Log timeout errors for debugging
  - [ ] Use application logger utility (consistent with other modules)
  - [ ] Include timestamps and relevant context in all log messages
- [ ] Export error handler utilities:
  - [ ] Export function to wrap async operations with error handling
  - [ ] Export function to wrap async handlers with retry and error handling
  - [ ] Export retry configuration constants/helpers
  - [ ] Export types/interfaces for error handler configuration
  - [ ] Export error classification utilities

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 3. Async Processing Setup
- **Rails Files to Reference:**
  - `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq error handling:
    - Line 34-37: `Sidekiq.default_job_options = { retry: 3, backtrace: true }` - Default retry 3 times, include backtraces
    - Line 31: `Sidekiq.logger.level = Logger::INFO` - Logging level
  - `jarek-va/app/jobs/application_job.rb` - Base job retry:
    - Line 14: `retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 3` - Retry 3 times with exponential backoff
    - Line 17: `discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError` - Discard deserialization errors
  - `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` - Job error handling example:
    - Lines 32-50: Try-catch with error logging and user notification
    - Line 33-34: `Rails.logger.error` with error message and backtrace
    - Line 50: Re-raise error to mark job as failed
- **Dependencies:**
  - Requires async utilities (completed in PHASE2-014)
  - Requires async configuration (completed in PHASE2-013)
  - Requires base async handler (completed in PHASE2-015)
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Since we're not using a queue system, error handling is done at the async operation level
  - Error handling should wrap async operations with try-catch and retry logic
  - Retry configuration should use async utilities from `src/utils/async.ts`
  - Exponential backoff: Use `withRetry` utility with exponential backoff (from PHASE2-014)
  - Error handlers should be utility functions that can wrap async operations
  - The error handler should be a utility that can be imported and used by async handler code
  - Logging should use the application's logger utility (not console.log)
  - Error logs should include: timestamp, operation identifier, error message, stack trace, operation data (if available)
  - Failed operation handling should log but not throw (to prevent cascading failures)
  - Error classification: Some errors (like deserialization errors) should not be retried
- **Key Differences from Rails:**
  - Rails: Sidekiq handles retries automatically based on job class configuration
  - Node.js: Retry logic must be explicitly applied using async utilities
  - Rails: Error handling is in job class `perform` method
  - Node.js: Error handling can be at both handler level (PHASE2-015) and operation level (this task)
  - Rails: Sidekiq logs errors automatically with backtraces
  - Node.js: Must explicitly wrap operations and log errors
- **Usage Pattern:**
  - Import error handler: `import { withErrorHandling, defaultRetryOptions } from '@/handlers/async-error-handler'`
  - When calling async operations: `await withErrorHandling(() => someAsyncOperation(), { retries: 3 })`
  - When using handlers: `await withErrorHandling(() => handler.handle(data), defaultRetryOptions)`
- **Testing Considerations:**
  - Test error handling wrapper catches errors correctly
  - Test retry logic is applied correctly
  - Test failed operation handler logs failed operations correctly
  - Test logging includes all required information
  - Test error handlers don't throw (prevent cascading failures)
  - Test error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent (after PHASE2-013, PHASE2-014, and PHASE2-015 are complete)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
