# PHASE2-015: Create base async handler

**Section**: 3. Async Processing Setup
**Subsection**: 3.4
**Task ID**: PHASE2-015

## Description

Create a base async handler pattern for TypeScript/Node.js. Since we're not using a queue system, this provides a common pattern for async operations with retry logic, error handling, and logging that matches the Rails `ApplicationJob` behavior.

**Rails Implementation Reference:**

- `jarek-va/app/jobs/application_job.rb` - Base job class using ActiveJob with Sidekiq adapter
  - Queue configuration: `queue_as :default` (line 11)
  - Retry configuration: `retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 3` (line 14)
  - Discard configuration: `discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError` (line 17)
  - All jobs extend this base class (e.g., `TelegramMessageJob < ApplicationJob`)

**Node.js Implementation:**

- Create `src/handlers/base-async-handler.ts` as an abstract base class or interface pattern
- Define default async handler configuration matching Rails behavior
- Implement retry configuration with exponential backoff (3 attempts) matching Rails behavior
- Add error handling for deserialization/parsing errors (equivalent to `discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError`)
- Define abstract `handle` method that child classes must implement
- Add logging infrastructure for async operations
- This base class/interface will be used by specific async handlers (e.g., `TelegramMessageHandler`)

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/handlers/base-async-handler.ts` file
- [ ] Define abstract base class or interface `BaseAsyncHandler`:
  - [ ] Abstract `handle` method signature: `abstract handle(data: T): Promise<R>`
  - [ ] Use generic types for input data and return value
  - [ ] Return `Promise<R>` for async processing
- [ ] Add default handler configuration:
  - [ ] Define default handler name/identifier (matching Rails concept of queue name)
  - [ ] Allow child classes to override handler name
  - [ ] Export handler name constant or getter method
- [ ] Implement retry configuration:
  - [ ] Configure retry attempts: 3 attempts (matching Rails `attempts: 3`)
  - [ ] Configure exponential backoff delay (matching Rails `wait: :exponentially_longer`)
  - [ ] Retry on StandardError/Error (matching Rails `retry_on StandardError`)
  - [ ] Use async utilities from `src/utils/async.ts` for retry logic
  - [ ] Provide static method or property that returns default handler options (including retry configuration)
- [ ] Add error handling:
  - [ ] Handle deserialization/parsing errors (discard, don't retry) - matching Rails `discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError`
  - [ ] Implement try-catch wrapper around handle method
  - [ ] Log errors appropriately before re-throwing or discarding
- [ ] Add logging:
  - [ ] Import logger utility
  - [ ] Log handler start/complete/failure events
  - [ ] Include handler name and operation identifier in log messages
- [ ] Export base class/interface:
  - [ ] Export `BaseAsyncHandler` class/interface for use by child handlers
  - [ ] Export any related types or interfaces
  - [ ] Export helper function to wrap handlers with retry and error handling

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 3. Async Processing Setup
- **Rails Files to Reference:**
  - `jarek-va/app/jobs/application_job.rb` - Base job class:
    - Line 11: `queue_as :default` - Default queue configuration
    - Line 14: `retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 3` - Retry with exponential backoff, 3 attempts
    - Line 17: `discard_on ActiveJob::DeserializationError` - Discard deserialization errors without retry
    - Extends `ActiveJob::Base` which provides the job processing infrastructure
  - `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` - Example job extending ApplicationJob:
    - Line 10: `class TelegramMessageJob < ApplicationJob` - Extends base class
    - Line 11: `queue_as :default` - Uses default queue (inherited from base, but can override)
    - Line 15: `def perform(update)` - Implements the job processing logic
- **Dependencies:**
  - Requires async utilities (completed in PHASE2-014)
  - Requires async configuration (completed in PHASE2-013)
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Since we're not using a queue system, we create a base handler pattern for async operations
  - The base handler provides:
    - Common retry/error handling logic
    - Default handler configuration
    - Logging infrastructure
    - Type safety for handler payloads
  - Child handlers will extend this base class/interface and implement the `handle` method
  - The `handle` method will be called directly (not via a queue worker)
  - Retry configuration should use async utilities from `src/utils/async.ts`
  - The base class should provide a helper function that wraps handlers with retry and error handling
  - Exponential backoff: Use `withRetry` utility with exponential backoff (from PHASE2-014)
  - For deserialization errors, check for specific error types (JSON parsing errors, etc.) and discard (don't retry)
  - The base class should provide a consistent interface for all async handlers
  - Note: Rails default job options include `retry: 3, backtrace: true` (from `config/initializers/sidekiq.rb`), but since `ApplicationJob` explicitly sets retry configuration, the base class should match the explicit `ApplicationJob` retry settings (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- **Key Differences from Rails:**
  - Rails: `ApplicationJob` extends `ActiveJob::Base` which handles job execution automatically via Sidekiq
  - Node.js: Uses native async/await patterns, handlers are called directly
  - Rails: Retry configuration is in the job class definition
  - Node.js: Retry configuration is applied via async utilities when calling handlers
  - Rails: `perform` method is the entry point
  - Node.js: `handle` method will be the entry point (called directly with async/await)
- **Usage Pattern:**
  - Child classes will extend: `class TelegramMessageHandler extends BaseAsyncHandler<TelegramUpdate, void>`
  - Child classes will implement: `async handle(data: TelegramUpdate): Promise<void> { ... }`
  - Child classes can override handler name if needed
  - The base class provides common error handling and logging
  - Handlers are called directly: `await handler.handle(data)`
- **Testing Considerations:**
  - Test that abstract class cannot be instantiated directly
  - Test that child classes must implement `handle` method
  - Test retry configuration is applied correctly
  - Test error handling for deserialization errors
  - Test logging functionality
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent (after PHASE2-013 and PHASE2-014 are complete)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
