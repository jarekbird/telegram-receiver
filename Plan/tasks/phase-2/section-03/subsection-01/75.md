# PHASE2-012: Install BullMQ dependencies

**Section**: 3. Queue System Setup (BullMQ)
**Subsection**: 3.1
**Task ID**: PHASE2-012

## Description

Install BullMQ dependencies for the TypeScript/Node.js application. BullMQ is the Node.js equivalent of Sidekiq used in the Rails application (`jarek-va`) for background job processing. This task ensures BullMQ and its required dependencies are properly installed and configured.

**Rails Implementation Reference:**

- `jarek-va/Gemfile` - Uses `sidekiq` gem (~> 7.0) for background job processing (line 25)
- `jarek-va/config/sidekiq.yml` - Sidekiq configuration with queue definitions and concurrency settings
- `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq initialization with Redis connection and default job options
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/application_job.rb` - Base job class using Sidekiq adapter
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` - Example job using Sidekiq for async processing

**Node.js Implementation:**

- BullMQ (`bullmq`) is the TypeScript/Node.js equivalent of Sidekiq
- BullMQ requires Redis connection (uses `ioredis` client)
- Both `bullmq` and `ioredis` should be in package.json dependencies
- Verify installation works correctly before proceeding to queue configuration

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify `bullmq` package is in package.json dependencies
- [ ] Verify `ioredis` package is in package.json dependencies (required by BullMQ)
- [ ] Check package versions are compatible:
  - [ ] `bullmq` version should be recent stable version (e.g., ^5.0.0 or higher)
  - [ ] `ioredis` version should be compatible with BullMQ requirements
- [ ] Run `npm install` to ensure packages are installed
- [ ] Verify installation by importing BullMQ in a test file:
  - [ ] `import { Queue, Worker } from 'bullmq'` should work without errors
  - [ ] `import Redis from 'ioredis'` should work without errors
- [ ] Check that TypeScript types are available (should be included with bullmq package)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 3. Queue System Setup (BullMQ)
- **Rails Files to Reference:**
  - `jarek-va/Gemfile` - Sidekiq gem dependency (line 25)
  - `jarek-va/config/sidekiq.yml` - Sidekiq queue configuration
  - `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq initialization and Redis connection
  - `jarek-va/app/jobs/application_job.rb` - Base job class using Sidekiq
- **Dependencies:**
  - Requires Redis to be set up (completed in Section 2: Redis Integration)
  - Uses `ioredis` for Redis connection (should already be in package.json from Redis setup)
  - BullMQ is built on top of Redis, similar to how Sidekiq uses Redis
- **Implementation Details:**
  - BullMQ replaces Sidekiq functionality in the Node.js conversion
  - Both use Redis as the backing store for job queues
  - BullMQ provides similar features: queues, workers, job processing, retries, etc.
  - Check `telegram-receiver/package.json` to verify current dependencies
  - If packages are already installed, verify they work correctly
  - If packages need to be added, use: `npm install bullmq ioredis`
- **Key Differences from Rails:**
  - Rails: Uses Sidekiq gem with Redis
  - Node.js: Uses BullMQ library with ioredis
  - Both use Redis, but the API and configuration differ
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent (after Redis setup is complete)

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
