# PHASE2-012: Verify async processing dependencies

**Section**: 3. Async Processing Setup
**Subsection**: 3.1
**Task ID**: PHASE2-012

## Description

Verify that all dependencies needed for async processing are available in the TypeScript/Node.js application. Since this application doesn't have regularly scheduled jobs, we will leverage Node.js's asynchronous nature instead of using a queue system like BullMQ or Sidekiq. This task ensures that Node.js native async capabilities are available and no queue system dependencies are needed.

**Rails Implementation Reference:**

- `jarek-va/Gemfile` - Uses `sidekiq` gem (~> 7.0) for background job processing (line 25)
- `jarek-va/config/sidekiq.yml` - Sidekiq configuration with queue definitions and concurrency settings
- `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq initialization with Redis connection and default job options
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/application_job.rb` - Base job class using Sidekiq adapter
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` - Example job using Sidekiq for async processing

**Node.js Implementation:**

- Node.js native async/await and Promise support (built-in, no dependencies needed)
- No queue system dependencies required (BullMQ is not needed)
- Verify that Node.js version supports async/await (Node.js 8+)
- Ensure TypeScript is configured for async/await support

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify Node.js version supports async/await (Node.js 8+ required, Node.js 14+ recommended)
- [ ] Verify TypeScript configuration supports async/await:
  - [ ] Check `tsconfig.json` has appropriate `target` setting (ES2017+ for async/await)
  - [ ] Verify `lib` includes Promise support
- [ ] Verify no queue system dependencies are needed:
  - [ ] Confirm `bullmq` is NOT in package.json (or can be removed if present)
  - [ ] Note: `ioredis` may still be needed for Redis operations (not for queues)
- [ ] Test async/await functionality:
  - [ ] Create a simple test file with async/await to verify it works
  - [ ] Verify Promise.all, Promise.race, and other Promise utilities work
- [ ] Document that async processing will use native Node.js capabilities

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 3. Async Processing Setup
- **Rails Files to Reference:**
  - `jarek-va/Gemfile` - Sidekiq gem dependency (line 25) - Note: We're NOT using a queue system equivalent
  - `jarek-va/config/sidekiq.yml` - Sidekiq queue configuration - Note: Not applicable, we use async patterns
  - `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq initialization - Note: Not applicable, we use async utilities
  - `jarek-va/app/jobs/application_job.rb` - Base job class using Sidekiq - Note: We use async handlers instead
- **Dependencies:**
  - Node.js native async/await support (built-in, no dependencies needed)
  - TypeScript async/await support (built-in with proper tsconfig)
  - Note: Redis may still be used for other purposes (not for queues)
  - Note: `ioredis` may still be in package.json for Redis operations, but not for queue system
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Since this application doesn't have regularly scheduled jobs, we use Node.js native async capabilities
  - No queue system is needed - operations run asynchronously using Promise-based patterns
  - Async operations will use `async/await` with proper error handling and retry logic
  - Check `telegram-receiver/package.json` to verify no queue system dependencies are needed
  - If `bullmq` is present, it can be removed (not needed for this application)
- **Key Differences from Rails:**
  - Rails: Uses Sidekiq gem with Redis for background job processing
  - Node.js: Uses native async/await with Promise-based patterns (no queue system needed)
  - Rails: Jobs are enqueued and processed by workers
  - Node.js: Operations are executed asynchronously directly
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

- Next: PHASE2-013

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
