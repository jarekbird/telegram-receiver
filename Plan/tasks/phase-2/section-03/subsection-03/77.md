# PHASE2-014: Create queue connection utility

**Section**: 3. Queue System Setup (BullMQ)
**Subsection**: 3.3
**Task ID**: PHASE2-014

## Description

Create a queue connection utility that provides a singleton Redis connection instance for BullMQ. This utility creates a reusable `Connection` instance that can be shared across all queue operations (creating queues, workers, etc.), matching the Redis connection pattern used by Sidekiq in the Rails application.

**Rails Implementation Reference:**

- `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq Redis connection configuration (lines 7-10 for server, lines 24-27 for client)
  - Both server and client configurations use the same Redis URL from `REDIS_URL` environment variable
  - Defaults to `redis://localhost:6379/0` if `REDIS_URL` is not set
  - In Docker: `REDIS_URL` is set to `redis://redis:6379/0` (shared Redis instance)

**Node.js Implementation:**

- Create `src/utils/queue.ts` to provide a singleton BullMQ `Connection` instance
- Initialize connection with Redis URL from environment variable
- Export the connection for reuse across the application
- This utility complements `src/config/queue.ts` (created in PHASE2-013) by providing the actual connection instance

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/utils/queue.ts` file
- [ ] Import `Connection` from `bullmq` package
- [ ] Implement singleton pattern for connection instance:
  - [ ] Create a module-level variable to store the connection instance
  - [ ] Create `getQueueConnection()` function that returns singleton instance
  - [ ] Initialize connection only once (lazy initialization)
- [ ] Configure Redis connection:
  - [ ] Use `REDIS_URL` environment variable (defaults to `redis://localhost:6379/0`)
  - [ ] Create `Connection` instance with Redis URL
  - [ ] Support both Docker (`redis://redis:6379/0`) and local development (`redis://localhost:6379/0`)
- [ ] Export connection:
  - [ ] Export `getQueueConnection()` function for use by queues and workers
  - [ ] Export the connection instance directly (optional, for advanced use cases)
- [ ] Add TypeScript types:
  - [ ] Import `Connection` type from `bullmq`
  - [ ] Type the return value of `getQueueConnection()`
- [ ] Add error handling:
  - [ ] Handle connection initialization errors
  - [ ] Log connection status appropriately

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 3. Queue System Setup (BullMQ)
- **Rails Files to Reference:**
  - `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq Redis connection:
    - Server configuration (lines 7-10): `config.redis = { url: ENV.fetch('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379/0') }`
    - Client configuration (lines 24-27): Same Redis URL configuration
    - Both use the same Redis instance (shared connection pattern)
    - Environment variable: `REDIS_URL` (defaults to `redis://localhost:6379/0`)
    - In Docker: `REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0` (shared Redis instance)
- **Dependencies:**
  - Requires BullMQ to be installed (completed in PHASE2-012)
  - Requires queue configuration to exist (completed in PHASE2-013)
  - Uses `REDIS_URL` environment variable (should be set in Docker: `redis://redis:6379/0`)
  - Note: This is separate from the Redis connection utility (`src/utils/redis.ts` from PHASE2-009). BullMQ's `Connection` class is a wrapper specifically for BullMQ queue operations, while the Redis utility provides direct Redis client access for other services.
- **Implementation Details:**
  - BullMQ's `Connection` class wraps the Redis connection and can be shared across multiple `Queue` and `Worker` instances
  - The connection utility should provide a singleton pattern to ensure all queues and workers use the same Redis connection
  - The `Connection` constructor accepts a connection options object with `host`, `port`, `password`, or a `url` property
  - For simplicity, use the `url` option: `new Connection({ url: redisUrl })`
  - The connection should be initialized lazily (only when first accessed) to avoid connection issues during module loading
  - This utility is separate from `src/config/queue.ts` (PHASE2-013):
    - `src/config/queue.ts`: Configuration settings (default job options, environment-specific settings)
    - `src/utils/queue.ts`: Connection instance (singleton Redis connection)
- **Key Differences from Rails:**
  - Rails: Sidekiq manages Redis connection internally via `config.redis` in configure blocks
  - Node.js: BullMQ requires explicit `Connection` instance that must be passed to `Queue` and `Worker` constructors
  - Rails: Connection is configured globally in initializer
  - Node.js: Connection instance must be created and passed to each queue/worker
- **Usage Pattern:**
  - Other modules will import: `import { getQueueConnection } from '@/utils/queue'`
  - When creating queues: `new Queue('queue-name', { connection: getQueueConnection() })`
  - When creating workers: `new Worker('queue-name', processor, { connection: getQueueConnection() })`
- **Testing Considerations:**
  - Test that connection is created correctly with Redis URL
  - Test that singleton pattern works (same instance returned on multiple calls)
  - Test that connection uses environment variable correctly
  - Test default Redis URL fallback
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent (after PHASE2-012 and PHASE2-013 are complete)

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
