# PHASE2-017: Test queue system

**Section**: 3. Queue System Setup (BullMQ)
**Subsection**: 3.6
**Task ID**: PHASE2-017

## Description

Create comprehensive tests for the BullMQ queue system, converting the queue system tests from Rails Sidekiq to TypeScript/Node.js. This includes testing queue configuration, job enqueueing, job processing, retry behavior, error handling, and queue operations.

**Rails Implementation Reference:**

- `jarek-va/spec/config/sidekiq_spec.rb` - Sidekiq configuration tests:
  - Tests Sidekiq module loading and configuration methods (lines 6-12)
  - Tests default job options (retry: 3, backtrace: true) (lines 14-22)
  - Tests Redis URL configuration from environment (lines 24-30)
  - Tests Sidekiq YAML configuration file existence and environment-specific settings (lines 53-68)
  - Note: ActiveJob adapter configuration tests (lines 33-50) are not applicable - BullMQ is used directly, not as an adapter
- `jarek-va/spec/jobs/application_job_spec.rb` - Base job tests:
  - Tests job configuration (inheritance from ActiveJob::Base, default queue name) (lines 16-24)
  - Tests retry configuration (retry_on, discard_on) (lines 26-52)
  - Tests job enqueueing (perform_later, with arguments, to different queues) (lines 54-76)
  - Tests job retry behavior (lines 78-93)
- `jarek-va/spec/support/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq test helpers:
  - Clears ActiveJob test queue before each test (lines 4-9)
  - Includes ActiveJob testing helpers (line 12)
- Note: `jarek-va/spec/routes/sidekiq_routes_spec.rb` (Sidekiq Web UI tests) is not applicable - BullMQ does not have a built-in web UI like Sidekiq

**Node.js Implementation:**

- Create `tests/unit/jobs/queue.test.ts` to test queue configuration and operations
- Create `tests/unit/jobs/application-job.test.ts` to test base job class functionality
- Test BullMQ queue configuration (connection, default options, environment-specific settings)
- Test job enqueueing with various arguments and queue names
- Test job processing and completion
- Test retry behavior and error handling
- Test queue error handlers (from PHASE2-016)
- Use BullMQ test utilities and mocks for isolated testing

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2: File-by-File Conversion
- Section: 3. Queue System Setup (BullMQ)
- **Rails Files to Reference:**

    - Lines 6-12: Sidekiq module loading and configuration methods (test BullMQ Connection/Queue initialization)
    - Lines 14-22: Default job options (retry: 3, backtrace: true) - test BullMQ default job options
    - Lines 24-30: Redis URL configuration from environment - test queue connection utility
    - Lines 33-50: ActiveJob adapter configuration - NOT APPLICABLE (BullMQ is used directly, not as an adapter)
    - Lines 53-68: Sidekiq YAML configuration file tests - NOT APPLICABLE (BullMQ doesn't use YAML config files; test environment-specific settings from queue config instead)
  - `jarek-va/spec/jobs/application_job_spec.rb` - Base job tests:
    - Lines 16-24: Job configuration (inheritance, default queue name) - test BaseJobProcessor class structure
    - Lines 26-52: Retry and discard configuration - test retry/discard logic in base job processor
    - Lines 54-76: Job enqueueing tests (with arguments, different queues) - test job enqueueing with BullMQ Queue.add()
    - Lines 78-93: Job retry behavior tests - test retry behavior with BullMQ
  - `jarek-va/spec/support/sidekiq.rb` - Sidekiq test helpers:
    - Lines 4-9: Clear ActiveJob test queue before each test - implement queue cleanup helpers
    - Line 12: Include ActiveJob testing helpers - create BullMQ test utilities
  - Note: `jarek-va/spec/routes/sidekiq_routes_spec.rb` is NOT APPLICABLE - BullMQ does not have a built-in web UI like Sidekiq's Web UI
- **Dependencies:**
  - Requires BullMQ to be installed (completed in PHASE2-012)
  - Requires queue connection utility (completed in PHASE2-014)
  - Requires queue configuration (completed in PHASE2-013)
  - Requires base job processor (completed in PHASE2-015)
  - Requires queue error handling (completed in PHASE2-016)
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Use Jest as the test framework (already configured in telegram-receiver)
  - Use BullMQ's test utilities for isolated testing (can use Redis mock or test Redis instance)
  - BullMQ provides `Queue` and `Worker` classes that can be tested
  - For unit tests, mock Redis connection or use test Redis instance
  - For integration tests, use actual Redis connection (test instance)
  - Test helpers should clean up queues and jobs between tests
  - Use `waitForJobs` or similar patterns to wait for async job completion
  - Test error scenarios: connection errors, job processing errors, retry exhaustion
  - Test success scenarios: job enqueueing, processing, completion
  - Test configuration: default options, environment-specific settings, queue names
- **Key Differences from Rails:**
  - Rails: Uses ActiveJob::TestHelper for testing (clears queues automatically)
  - Node.js: Must manually clear queues or use test utilities (implement in queueHelpers.ts)
  - Rails: Sidekiq tests use ActiveJob test adapter in test environment
  - Node.js: BullMQ requires explicit Queue/Worker instances for testing (no adapter pattern)
  - Rails: Tests can use `have_enqueued_job` matchers
  - Node.js: Must check queue state directly or use BullMQ's job inspection methods (e.g., `queue.getJobs()`)
  - Rails: Sidekiq has built-in Web UI (tested in sidekiq_routes_spec.rb)
  - Node.js: BullMQ does not have a built-in web UI (no equivalent tests needed)
  - Rails: Sidekiq uses YAML configuration file (sidekiq.yml)
  - Node.js: BullMQ uses TypeScript configuration files (no YAML config to test)
- **Testing Patterns:**
  - Unit tests: Mock Queue/Worker instances, test configuration and options
  - Integration tests: Use real Queue/Worker instances with test Redis
  - Test helpers: Create reusable functions for common test operations
  - Cleanup: Always clean up queues and jobs after tests to prevent test pollution
- **Test Coverage Goals:**
  - Queue configuration: 100% coverage
  - Job enqueueing: 100% coverage
  - Job processing: 100% coverage
  - Error handling: 100% coverage
  - Retry behavior: 100% coverage
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent (after PHASE2-012, PHASE2-013, PHASE2-014, PHASE2-015, and PHASE2-016 are complete)

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
