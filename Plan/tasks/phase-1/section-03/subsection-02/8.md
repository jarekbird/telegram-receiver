# PHASE1-008: Create test tsconfig.json

**Section**: 3. TypeScript Configuration
**Subsection**: 3.2
**Task ID**: PHASE1-008

## Description

Create a TypeScript configuration file specifically for test files (`tsconfig.test.json`). This configuration extends the base `tsconfig.json` and adds Jest-specific type definitions and test-specific compiler options. This allows TypeScript to properly type-check test files that import from both the `tests/` and `src/` directories while providing Jest and Node.js type definitions.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `tsconfig.test.json` file
- [ ] Extend base `tsconfig.json` using `"extends": "./tsconfig.json"`
- [ ] Override `compilerOptions.outDir` to "./dist-test" (separate output directory for test compilation)
- [ ] Override `compilerOptions.rootDir` to "." (project root, since we include both tests/ and src/ directories)
- [ ] Add `compilerOptions.types` array with ["jest", "node"] (provides Jest and Node.js type definitions)
- [ ] Set `include` array to ["tests/**/*", "src/**/*"] (include both test files and source files for type-checking)
- [ ] Set `exclude` array to ["node_modules", "dist", "dist-test", "coverage"] (exclude build outputs and dependencies)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 3. TypeScript Configuration
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- The `rootDir` must be "." (project root) rather than "./tests" because the configuration includes files from both `tests/` and `src/` directories. TypeScript requires all included files to be under the `rootDir`.
- This configuration is used by TypeScript for type-checking test files and can be referenced by IDEs and type-checking tools
- The separate `outDir` of "./dist-test" ensures test compilation outputs don't mix with production build outputs

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
