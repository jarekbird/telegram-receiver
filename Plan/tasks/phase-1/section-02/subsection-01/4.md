# PHASE1-004: Create source directory structure

**Section**: 2. Project Structure Setup
**Subsection**: 2.1
**Task ID**: PHASE1-004

## Description

Create source directory structure that aligns with the Rails application structure from jarek-va. This establishes the foundational directory layout for the Node.js/TypeScript conversion.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/` directory (if it doesn't exist)
- [ ] Create `src/index.ts` file (empty initially, will be the application entry point)
- [ ] Create `src/config/` directory (for configuration files, equivalent to Rails `config/`)
- [ ] Create `src/controllers/` directory (for Express route handlers, equivalent to Rails `app/controllers/`)
- [ ] Create `src/services/` directory (for business logic, equivalent to Rails `app/services/`)
- [ ] Create `src/models/` directory (for data models/entities, equivalent to Rails `app/models/`)
- [ ] Create `src/jobs/` directory (for background job processors, equivalent to Rails `app/jobs/`)
- [ ] Create `src/middleware/` directory (for Express middleware functions)
- [ ] Create `src/routes/` directory (for route definitions, equivalent to Rails `config/routes.rb`)
- [ ] Create `src/utils/` directory (for utility functions and helpers)
- [ ] Create `src/types/` directory (for TypeScript type definitions and interfaces)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 2. Project Structure Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- The directory structure mirrors the Rails application structure (`app/controllers/`, `app/services/`, `app/models/`, `app/jobs/`) to maintain consistency and ease conversion
- Additional directories (`middleware/`, `routes/`, `utils/`, `types/`) are Node.js/TypeScript-specific and will be used throughout the application
- Subdirectories within these main directories (e.g., `services/tools/`, `services/telegram_message_processors/`) will be created when those specific components are converted in later phases

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
