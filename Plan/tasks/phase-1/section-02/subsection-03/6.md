# PHASE1-006: Create configuration files directory

**Section**: 2. Project Structure Setup
**Subsection**: 2.3
**Task ID**: PHASE1-006

## Description

Create configuration files directory and environment variable files for the Node.js application. This task sets up the environment variable configuration files that replace Rails environment-specific configuration files (`config/environments/development.rb`, `config/environments/test.rb`, `config/environments/production.rb`) and centralizes environment variables defined in `config/application.rb`.

The `.env` files serve as the Node.js equivalent of Rails environment-specific configs, allowing different configuration values for development, test, and production environments.

## Rails Reference

This task replaces the following Rails configuration files:

- `jarek-va/config/application.rb` - Defines environment variables using `ENV.fetch()`
- `jarek-va/config/environments/development.rb` - Development environment config
- `jarek-va/config/environments/test.rb` - Test environment config
- `jarek-va/config/environments/production.rb` - Production environment config

Key environment variables from Rails `config/application.rb`:

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Telegram bot API token
- `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Secret token for webhook authentication
- `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` - Base URL for Telegram webhook callbacks
- `CURSOR_RUNNER_URL` - URL of the cursor-runner service
- `CURSOR_RUNNER_TIMEOUT` - Timeout for cursor-runner requests (seconds)
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection URL
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - ElevenLabs API key for audio features
- `ELEVENLABS_STT_MODEL_ID` - ElevenLabs speech-to-text model ID
- `ELEVENLABS_TTS_MODEL_ID` - ElevenLabs text-to-speech model ID
- `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` - ElevenLabs voice ID for TTS
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Admin webhook secret
- `APP_NAME` - Application name
- `APP_VERSION` - Application version
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (info, debug, etc.)
- `DEFAULT_NOTES_REPOSITORY` - Default repository for note operations
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Node.js environment (development, test, production)

## Checklist

- [x] Create root-level `config/` directory (for non-TypeScript configuration files, if needed)
- [x] Create `.env.example` file with all required environment variables and example values
- [x] Create `.env.development` file with development-specific values (localhost URLs, development settings)
- [x] Create `.env.test` file with test-specific values (test tokens, shorter timeouts, test database)
- [x] Ensure all environment variables from Rails `config/application.rb` are included in `.env.example`
- [x] Document each environment variable with comments explaining its purpose
- [x] Use appropriate default values matching Rails defaults where applicable

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 2. Project Structure Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- The `.env` files replace Rails environment-specific configuration files
- Root-level `.env` files are used for environment variables (standard Node.js practice)
- The `src/config/` directory (created in PHASE1-004) is for TypeScript configuration modules, not environment files
- Environment variables should match the names and purposes defined in Rails `config/application.rb`
- `.env.example` should contain all variables with example/placeholder values (no real secrets)
- `.env.development` should use localhost URLs and development-friendly settings
- `.env.test` should use test values, shorter timeouts, and test database URLs
- Production environment variables are typically set via deployment configuration (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.) rather than a `.env.production` file for security reasons

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
