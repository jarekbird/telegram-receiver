# PHASE1-005: Create test directory structure

**Section**: 2. Project Structure Setup
**Subsection**: 2.2
**Task ID**: PHASE1-005

## Description

Create test directory structure for organizing unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, fixtures, helpers, and mocks. This establishes the foundational test organization that mirrors common Node.js/TypeScript testing patterns and supports the conversion from Rails RSpec tests.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `tests/` directory (root test directory)
- [ ] Create `tests/unit/` directory (for unit tests of individual components)
- [ ] Create `tests/integration/` directory (for integration tests that test multiple components together)
- [ ] Create `tests/e2e/` directory (for end-to-end tests using Playwright)
- [ ] Create `tests/fixtures/` directory (for test data fixtures and sample API responses)
- [ ] Create `tests/helpers/` directory (for test utility functions and shared test helpers)
- [ ] Create `tests/mocks/` directory (for reusable mock implementations of external services)
- [ ] Create `tests/setup.ts` file (Jest setup file with basic configuration: NODE_ENV=test, timeout settings, and global test utilities)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 2. Project Structure Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- The test directory structure follows Node.js/TypeScript best practices:
  - `unit/` - Tests for individual functions, classes, and modules in isolation
  - `integration/` - Tests for API endpoints and service interactions
  - `e2e/` - End-to-end tests using Playwright for full user flows
  - `fixtures/` - Reusable test data (API responses, sample messages, etc.)
  - `helpers/` - Shared test utilities and helper functions
  - `mocks/` - Reusable mock implementations for external services (Telegram API, Cursor Runner API, Redis, etc.)
- The `setup.ts` file should contain basic Jest configuration (NODE_ENV, timeout, global utilities) and will be referenced in `jest.config.ts` via `setupFilesAfterEnv`
- This structure supports the conversion from Rails RSpec tests (`spec/` directory) to Jest tests

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
