# PHASE1-030: Choose logging library

**Section**: 8. Logging Infrastructure
**Subsection**: 8.1
**Task ID**: PHASE1-030

## Description

Choose a logging library for the Node.js application that can replicate the Rails logging patterns used in jarek-va. The library must support structured logging, multiple log levels (info, error, warn, debug), request ID tagging, environment-based configuration, and stdout logging for production/Docker environments.

**Rails Logging Patterns to Replicate:**

- The jarek-va Rails application uses `Rails.logger` extensively throughout controllers, services, jobs, and tools
- Application-level log level: Configurable via `ENV['LOG_LEVEL']` (defaults to `'info'`), see `jarek-va/config/application.rb` line 28
- Production logging: Log level `:info`, stdout logging with request_id tagging via `ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging` wrapper (see `jarek-va/config/environments/production.rb` lines 40, 43, 67-69)
  - Uses `Logger::Formatter.new` which includes PID and timestamp in log output (line 60)
  - When `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT` is set, wraps stdout logger with `ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging` to prepend request_id tags
- Development logging: Rails defaults to `:debug` log level (no explicit configuration in `development.rb`)
- Error logging includes full backtraces: logs exception class/message and full backtrace as separate log entries (see `jarek-va/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` lines 10-11)
- Sidekiq uses Logger::INFO level (see `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` line 31)
- Logging methods used: `Rails.logger.info()`, `Rails.logger.error()`, `Rails.logger.warn()`, `Rails.logger.debug()` (debug can use blocks for lazy evaluation, see `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` line 180)

**Requirements from Related Tasks:**

- PHASE1-020 (request logging middleware): Requires structured JSON logging format with request_id support
- PHASE1-031 (logger configuration): Requires JSON format for production, pretty format for development, environment-based log levels
- PHASE1-032 (logger utility wrapper): Requires consistent interface with `logger.info()`, `logger.error()`, `logger.warn()`, `logger.debug()` methods

## Checklist

- [ ] Research logging options (winston, pino, bunyan) and compare:
  - [ ] Performance (Pino is significantly faster than Winston)
  - [ ] Structured logging support (JSON format)
  - [ ] Environment-based configuration (log levels, formats)
  - [ ] Request ID/tagging support (for request tracing)
  - [ ] Error logging with stack traces
  - [ ] TypeScript type definitions availability
  - [ ] Production readiness (stdout logging, Docker-friendly)
  - [ ] Ecosystem and community support
- [ ] Consider Pino as primary recommendation (fast, structured JSON logging, excellent performance)
- [ ] Consider Winston as alternative (more flexible, larger ecosystem, but slower)
- [ ] Decide on logging library based on requirements
- [ ] Install chosen logging library as production dependency
- [ ] Install TypeScript types if available as dev dependency (e.g., `@types/pino` or `@types/winston`)
- [ ] Verify library supports:
  - [ ] Multiple log levels (info, error, warn, debug)
  - [ ] Structured JSON logging
  - [ ] Environment-based log level configuration (via `NODE_ENV` and `LOG_LEVEL` env var)
  - [ ] Pretty printing for development
  - [ ] Request ID/tagging support (via child loggers or context, similar to Rails TaggedLogging)
  - [ ] Error logging with stack traces (full exception backtraces)
  - [ ] stdout/stderr transport for production (Docker-friendly)
  - [ ] Log formatter that includes timestamp (and optionally PID) in output

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 8. Logging Infrastructure
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Rails Reference**: The jarek-va Rails application uses `Rails.logger` throughout the codebase. See:
  - `jarek-va/config/application.rb` (line 28) - Application-level log level configuration via `ENV['LOG_LEVEL']` (defaults to 'info')
  - `jarek-va/config/environments/production.rb` (lines 40, 43, 60, 67-69) - Production logging configuration:
    - Line 40: Log level set to `:info`
    - Line 43: Log tags set to `[:request_id]` for request ID tagging
    - Line 60: Log formatter configured to include PID and timestamp
    - Lines 67-69: Stdout logging with TaggedLogging wrapper when `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT` is set
  - `jarek-va/config/environments/development.rb` - Development environment (Rails defaults to `:debug` log level)
  - `jarek-va/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` (lines 10-11) - Error logging with full backtraces (exception class/message and backtrace as separate log entries)
  - `jarek-va/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` (line 31) - Sidekiq logging level set to `Logger::INFO`
  - Various service files use `Rails.logger.info()`, `Rails.logger.error()`, `Rails.logger.warn()`, `Rails.logger.debug()` (debug can use blocks for lazy evaluation)
- **Performance Consideration**: Pino is significantly faster than Winston (often 5-10x faster) due to asynchronous logging and JSON serialization optimizations. This is important for high-throughput API applications.
- **Structured Logging**: The chosen library must support structured JSON logging for production (as required by PHASE1-020 and PHASE1-031) to enable log aggregation and analysis.
- **Request ID Support**: The library should support adding request IDs to log entries (via child loggers or context) to match Rails' `config.log_tags = [:request_id]` behavior. Rails uses `ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging` wrapper which prepends tags to each log line, so the Node.js implementation should support similar tagging/context functionality.
- **Environment Configuration**: The library must support different log levels and formats based on `NODE_ENV` (production: info level + JSON, development: debug level + pretty format). The log level should also be configurable via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (defaulting to 'info') to match Rails' `ENV['LOG_LEVEL']` configuration.
- **Production/Docker**: The library must support stdout logging for containerized environments (as Rails does with `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT`).

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
