# PHASE1-016: Test health endpoint with automated tests

**Section**: 5. Health Check Endpoint
**Subsection**: 5.4
**Task ID**: PHASE1-016

## Description

Create automated tests to verify the health endpoint returns the correct response format matching the Rails implementation. This task validates that the health endpoint implementation from PHASE1-013, PHASE1-014, and PHASE1-015 works correctly through automated testing.

**IMPORTANT: Never run the server manually for testing. Use automated tests instead.**

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/health_controller.rb` (for expected response format)

## Checklist

- [ ] Create integration test file for health endpoint (e.g., `tests/integration/health.test.ts`)
- [ ] Use Supertest or similar testing library to test HTTP endpoints
- [ ] Write test for `GET /health` endpoint:
  - [ ] Verify response status code is 200
  - [ ] Verify response body is JSON with:
    - `status: "healthy"` (must match Rails implementation, not "ok")
    - `service: string` (should be `'Virtual Assistant API'` or value from `APP_NAME` env var)
    - `version: string` (should be `'1.0.0'` or value from `APP_VERSION` env var)
- [ ] Write test for `GET /` (root route):
  - [ ] Verify root route also returns same health response
  - [ ] Verify response status code is 200
  - [ ] Verify response body matches health endpoint format
- [ ] Run tests: `npm test` or `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass

## Validation Report

### Task Review: PHASE1-016

#### Task Information

- **Task ID**: PHASE1-016
- **Task Title**: Test health endpoint with automated tests
- **Rails File**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/health_controller.rb` (for response format reference)

#### Validation Results

##### ✓ Correct

- Task correctly identifies the need for automated testing
- Test approach using Supertest is appropriate
- Task follows logical sequence (after implementation tasks PHASE1-013, PHASE1-014, PHASE1-015)
- Task scope is appropriate - focused on automated verification

##### ⚠️ Issues Found

1. **Incorrect Expected Response Format**
   - **Issue**: Task expects `{ status: "ok" }` but Rails implementation and PHASE1-013 specify `{ status: "healthy", service: "...", version: "..." }`
   - **Location**: Checklist item 4
   - **Impact**: Test will fail or incorrectly validate the endpoint, as the actual response doesn't match expectations
   - **Fix Required**: Update to verify the correct response format:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "healthy",
       "service": "Virtual Assistant API",
       "version": "1.0.0"
     }
     ```

2. **Missing Response Fields Verification**
   - **Issue**: Task only verifies `status` field, but Rails implementation returns three fields: `status`, `service`, and `version`
   - **Location**: Checklist item 4
   - **Impact**: Incomplete test validation - won't verify that all fields are present and correct
   - **Fix Required**: Add verification for all three fields: `status`, `service`, and `version`

3. **Missing Status Code Verification**
   - **Issue**: Task doesn't explicitly verify HTTP status code is 200
   - **Location**: Missing from checklist
   - **Impact**: Test may not catch if endpoint returns wrong status code
   - **Fix Required**: Add checklist item to verify response status code is 200

4. **Missing Root Route Testing**
   - **Issue**: Rails implementation has both `/health` and `/` (root) routes pointing to the same controller, but task only tests `/health`
   - **Location**: Missing from checklist
   - **Impact**: Root route functionality won't be validated, breaking Rails API contract
   - **Fix Required**: Add checklist item to test root route (`GET /`) and verify it returns the same health response

5. **Unclear Port Specification**
   - **Issue**: Task says `http://localhost:PORT/health` but doesn't specify how to determine PORT
   - **Location**: Checklist item 3
   - **Impact**: Tester may not know what port to use
   - **Fix Required**: Add checklist item to determine port (check `process.env.PORT` or default from `src/index.ts`)

6. **Incomplete Description**
   - **Issue**: Description should emphasize automated testing instead of manual testing
   - **Location**: Description section
   - **Impact**: Doesn't provide enough context about what this test validates
   - **Fix Required**: Expand description to mention creating automated tests to validate the health endpoint implementation and matching Rails response format

7. **Missing Rails Reference**
   - **Issue**: Task doesn't reference the Rails health controller for expected response format
   - **Location**: Missing from description
   - **Impact**: Less context for understanding what the expected response should be
   - **Fix Required**: Add Rails reference: `jarek-va/app/controllers/health_controller.rb`

##### 📝 Recommendations

1. **Update Expected Response**: Change checklist item 4 from:
   - `Verify response is { status: "ok" }`
   - To: Verify response body is JSON with:
     - `status: "healthy"` (must match Rails implementation)
     - `service: string` (should be `'Virtual Assistant API'` or value from `APP_NAME` env var)
     - `version: string` (should be `'1.0.0'` or value from `APP_VERSION` env var)

2. **Add Status Code Verification**: Add checklist item:
   - "Verify response status code is 200"

3. **Add Root Route Testing**: Add checklist item:
   - "Write test for `GET /` (root route) using Supertest"
   - "Verify root route also returns same health response"

4. **Clarify Port**: Add checklist item:
   - "Determine server port (check `process.env.PORT` or default port from `src/index.ts`)"

5. **Expand Description**: Update to:
   - "Create automated tests to verify the health endpoint returns the correct response format matching the Rails implementation. This task validates that the health endpoint implementation from PHASE1-013, PHASE1-014, and PHASE1-015 works correctly through automated testing."

6. **Add Rails Reference**: Add to description:
   - **Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/health_controller.rb` (for expected response format)

#### Detailed Comparison

##### Expected Response Format

**Rails Implementation** (`health_controller.rb:5-9`):

```ruby
render json: {
  status: 'healthy',
  service: Rails.application.config.app_name || 'Virtual Assistant API',
  version: Rails.application.config.app_version || '1.0.0'
}
```

**Task Specification**:

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

**Discrepancy**:

- ❌ Status value is incorrect (`"ok"` vs `"healthy"`)
- ❌ Missing `service` field
- ❌ Missing `version` field

**Correct Expected Response** (based on PHASE1-013 and Rails):

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Virtual Assistant API",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

##### Routes to Test

**Rails Implementation** (`routes.rb:4-5, 8`):

- `GET /health` → `health#show`
- `GET /` (root) → `health#show`

**Task Specification**:

- Only tests `GET /health`
- Missing root route test

**Discrepancy**: Task doesn't test root route, which is part of Rails API contract

##### Test Coverage

**Rails Tests** (`health_controller_spec.rb` - inferred):

- Verifies 200 status code
- Verifies `status: 'healthy'`
- Verifies `service` field is present
- Verifies `version` field is present

**Task Coverage**:

- ⚠️ Missing status code verification
- ❌ Incorrect status value check (`"ok"` instead of `"healthy"`)
- ❌ Missing `service` field verification
- ❌ Missing `version` field verification
- ❌ Missing root route test

##### Dependencies

- **Previous Tasks**: PHASE1-013 (controller), PHASE1-014 (route), PHASE1-015 (route registration)
- **Server Setup**: Requires `src/index.ts` to be configured with port
- **Environment Variables**: May use `APP_NAME` and `APP_VERSION` (should be tested)
- **Task Coverage**: Task correctly depends on previous implementation tasks

##### Testing Approach

- **Automated Testing**: Required - use Supertest or similar for HTTP endpoint testing
- **No Manual Server Testing**: Never run the server manually (`npm start`, `npm run dev`) for testing
- **Task Coverage**: Automated testing approach is correct and follows best practices

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 5. Health Check Endpoint
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/health_controller.rb` (for expected response format)
- **Previous Tasks**: This task validates the implementation from PHASE1-013 (controller), PHASE1-014 (route), and PHASE1-015 (route registration)
- **Expected Response Format**: The health endpoint should return:

  ```json
  {
    "status": "healthy",
    "service": "Virtual Assistant API",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
  ```

  - Note: Status must be `"healthy"` (not `"ok"`) to match Rails implementation
  - `service` and `version` may come from `APP_NAME` and `APP_VERSION` environment variables

- **Routes to Test**: Both `/health` and `/` (root) routes should be tested, as Rails has both routes pointing to the same controller
- **Testing Approach**: Use Supertest or similar testing library to test HTTP endpoints without running the server manually. Tests should verify both `/health` and `/` routes return the correct response format.

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

CRITICAL: DO NOT create agents or tasks that process tasks from the database. The task operator already handles this automatically. Creating agents or tasks with prompts like "Process ready tasks", "Query the tasks table", or "Send task prompts to cursor-runner" will create recursive loops and is strictly forbidden. If you need to process tasks, ensure the task_operator system setting is enabled - do not create additional agents or tasks for this purpose.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
  - CRITICAL: Never create agents with prompts about processing tasks - the task operator handles this automatically
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute. However, DO NOT create agents for processing tasks - use the task operator system setting instead.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
