# PHASE1-013: Create health check controller

**Section**: 5. Health Check Endpoint
**Subsection**: 5.1
**Task ID**: PHASE1-013

## Description

Create health check controller that returns application health status, service name, and version information. This endpoint should match the Rails implementation in `jarek-va/app/controllers/health_controller.rb`.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/health_controller.rb`

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/controllers/health.controller.ts` file
- [ ] Create `getHealth` function
- [ ] Function should return status 200
- [ ] Function should return JSON with:
  - `status: "healthy"` (not "ok" - must match Rails implementation)
  - `service: string` (from `process.env.APP_NAME` or default to `'Virtual Assistant API'`)
  - `version: string` (from `process.env.APP_VERSION` or default to `'1.0.0'`)
- [ ] Export `getHealth` function
- [ ] Support environment variables: `APP_NAME` and `APP_VERSION` with defaults

## Validation Report

### Task Review: PHASE1-013

#### Task Information

- **Task ID**: PHASE1-013
- **Task Title**: Create health check controller
- **Rails File**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/health_controller.rb`
- **Validation Date**: 2025-01-17

#### Validation Results

##### ✓ Task Validated - All Issues Resolved

The task has been reviewed against the Rails implementation and all previously identified issues have been resolved. The checklist now accurately reflects the Rails implementation.

##### ✓ Correct Implementation Details

1. **Status Value**: ✓ Correctly specifies `status: "healthy"` (matches Rails implementation)
2. **Response Fields**: ✓ Includes all three required fields: `status`, `service`, and `version`
3. **Environment Variables**: ✓ Supports `APP_NAME` and `APP_VERSION` with correct defaults
4. **Root Route**: ✓ Documented in Notes section (handled separately in routing task)

#### Detailed Comparison

##### Methods in Rails File

1. `show` method (Rails) → `getHealth` function (TypeScript)
   - **Task coverage**: ✓ Complete
   - **Notes**: Method name conversion is appropriate for TypeScript/Express.js conventions

##### Response Structure Comparison

**Rails Implementation** (`health_controller.rb:5-9`):

```ruby
render json: {
  status: 'healthy',
  service: Rails.application.config.app_name || 'Virtual Assistant API',
  version: Rails.application.config.app_version || '1.0.0'
}
```

**Task Specification** (Checklist items 18-21):

```typescript
{
  status: "healthy",  // ✓ Matches Rails
  service: string,    // ✓ From process.env.APP_NAME or default 'Virtual Assistant API'
  version: string     // ✓ From process.env.APP_VERSION or default '1.0.0'
}
```

**Status**: ✓ Task specification matches Rails implementation exactly

##### Dependencies

- **Rails**: `ApplicationController` (base class)
- **Config**: `Rails.application.config.app_name`, `Rails.application.config.app_version`
- **Environment**: `APP_NAME`, `APP_VERSION` environment variables
- **Task Coverage**: ✓ Fully covered in checklist items 20-21 and 23

##### Error Handling

- **Rails**: None (simple response)
- **Task Coverage**: ✓ Acceptable - no error handling needed for this simple endpoint

##### Routes

- **Rails**:
  - `GET /health` → `health#show`
  - `GET /` (root) → `health#show`
- **Task Coverage**: ✓ Documented in Notes section (line 137) - routing handled separately

##### Test Requirements

- **Rails Tests** (`health_controller_spec.rb`):
  - Verifies 200 status
  - Verifies `status: 'healthy'`
  - Verifies `service` field is present
  - Verifies `version` field is present
- **Task Coverage**: ✓ Appropriate - testing handled in separate testing task

#### Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **VALIDATED** - Task is accurate and complete

All checklist items correctly match the Rails implementation:

- ✓ Correct status value (`"healthy"`)
- ✓ All response fields included (`status`, `service`, `version`)
- ✓ Environment variable support with correct defaults
- ✓ Root route documented in Notes
- ✓ File structure and naming conventions appropriate for TypeScript/Express.js

The task is ready for implementation.

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 5. Health Check Endpoint
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Important**: In the Rails implementation, this endpoint also serves as the root route (`GET /`). Route configuration should be handled in a separate routing task, but the controller function should be reusable for both `/health` and `/` routes.
- **Environment Variables**: The implementation should read `APP_NAME` and `APP_VERSION` from environment variables, defaulting to `'Virtual Assistant API'` and `'1.0.0'` respectively if not set.

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
