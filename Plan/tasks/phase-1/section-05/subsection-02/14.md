# PHASE1-014: Create health check route

**Section**: 5. Health Check Endpoint
**Subsection**: 5.2
**Task ID**: PHASE1-014

## Description

Create Express route file for health check endpoint that maps GET `/health` to the health controller function. This route file will be registered in the main app in a subsequent task.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/config/routes.rb` (lines 4-5, 8)

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/routes/health.routes.ts` file
- [ ] Import Express Router from `express`
- [ ] Import `getHealth` function from `src/controllers/health.controller.ts`
- [ ] Create router instance using `express.Router()`
- [ ] Add GET route: `router.get('/health', getHealth)`
- [ ] Export router as default export

## Validation Report

### Task Review: PHASE1-014

#### Task Information

- **Task ID**: PHASE1-014
- **Task Title**: Create health check route
- **Rails File**: `jarek-va/config/routes.rb` (lines 4-5, 8)

#### Validation Results

##### ✓ Task Validated - All Issues Resolved

The task has been reviewed against the Rails implementation and all previously identified issues have been resolved. The checklist now accurately reflects the Rails implementation.

##### ✓ Correct Implementation Details

1. **Controller Function Reference**: ✓ Checklist item 17 correctly specifies importing `getHealth` function from `src/controllers/health.controller.ts`
2. **Route Handler Specification**: ✓ Checklist item 19 correctly specifies the route pattern: `router.get('/health', getHealth)`
3. **Rails Reference**: ✓ Description includes Rails reference: `jarek-va/config/routes.rb` (lines 4-5, 8)
4. **Description**: ✓ Description clearly explains the task: "Create Express route file for health check endpoint that maps GET `/health` to the health controller function"
5. **Root Route Note**: ✓ Notes section documents that root route is handled separately in PHASE1-015
6. **File Structure**: ✓ File path structure (`src/routes/health.routes.ts`) is appropriate for Express.js structure
7. **Task Scope**: ✓ Task scope is appropriate - focused on route definition only

#### Detailed Comparison

##### Routes in Rails File

**Rails Implementation** (`routes.rb:4-5, 8`):

```ruby
# Health check endpoint
get 'health', to: 'health#show'

# Root endpoint
root 'health#show'
```

**Task Specification**:

- Create route file with GET `/health` route
- Import `getHealth` function from controller
- Export router

**Comparison**:

- ✓ Route path `/health` matches Rails `'health'`
- ✓ HTTP method GET matches Rails `get`
- ✓ Controller function name `getHealth` correctly specified (matches PHASE1-013)
- ✓ Root route documented in Notes section (handled separately in PHASE1-015)

##### Dependencies

- **Express Router**: Required for route definition
- **Health Controller**: `getHealth` function from `src/controllers/health.controller.ts` (created in PHASE1-013)
- **Task Coverage**: ✓ Fully covered - checklist item 17 specifies importing `getHealth` function

##### Route Structure

- **Rails**: Route defined in `routes.rb` using `get 'health', to: 'health#show'`
- **Express**: Route defined in separate route file using `router.get('/health', getHealth)`
- **Task Coverage**: ✓ Structure is correct and handler specification is explicit in checklist item 19

##### Related Components

- **Controller**: Created in PHASE1-013 (`health.controller.ts` with `getHealth` function)
- **Route Registration**: Handled in PHASE1-015 (registering route in main app)
- **Task Coverage**: ✓ Task correctly focuses only on route definition

#### Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **VALIDATED** - Task is accurate and complete

All checklist items correctly match the Rails implementation:

- ✓ Correct route path (`/health` matches Rails `'health'`)
- ✓ Correct HTTP method (GET matches Rails `get`)
- ✓ Controller function name explicitly specified (`getHealth`)
- ✓ Route handler pattern explicitly specified (`router.get('/health', getHealth)`)
- ✓ Rails reference included in description
- ✓ Root route documented in Notes section
- ✓ File structure and naming conventions appropriate for TypeScript/Express.js

The task is ready for implementation.

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 5. Health Check Endpoint
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/config/routes.rb` (lines 4-5, 8)
- **Controller Reference**: Uses `getHealth` function from `src/controllers/health.controller.ts` (created in PHASE1-013)
- **Note**: In Rails, the health endpoint also serves as the root route (`GET /`). Root route registration will be handled in PHASE1-015 when registering routes in the main app.

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
