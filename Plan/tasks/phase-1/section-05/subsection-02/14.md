# PHASE1-014: Create health check route

**Section**: 5. Health Check Endpoint
**Subsection**: 5.2
**Task ID**: PHASE1-014

## Description

Create Express route file for health check endpoint that maps GET `/health` to the health controller function. This route file will be registered in the main app in a subsequent task.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/config/routes.rb` (lines 4-5, 8)

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/routes/health.routes.ts` file
- [ ] Import Express Router from `express`
- [ ] Import `getHealth` function from `src/controllers/health.controller.ts`
- [ ] Create router instance using `express.Router()`
- [ ] Add GET route: `router.get('/health', getHealth)`
- [ ] Export router as default export

## Validation Report

### Task Review: PHASE1-014

#### Task Information

- **Task ID**: PHASE1-014
- **Task Title**: Create health check route
- **Rails File**: `jarek-va/config/routes.rb` (lines 4-5, 8)

#### Validation Results

##### ✓ Task Validated - All Issues Resolved

The task has been reviewed against the Rails implementation and all previously identified issues have been resolved. The checklist now accurately reflects the Rails implementation.

##### ✓ Correct Implementation Details

1. **Controller Function Reference**: ✓ Checklist item 17 correctly specifies importing `getHealth` function from `src/controllers/health.controller.ts`
2. **Route Handler Specification**: ✓ Checklist item 19 correctly specifies the route pattern: `router.get('/health', getHealth)`
3. **Rails Reference**: ✓ Description includes Rails reference: `jarek-va/config/routes.rb` (lines 4-5, 8)
4. **Description**: ✓ Description clearly explains the task: "Create Express route file for health check endpoint that maps GET `/health` to the health controller function"
5. **Root Route Note**: ✓ Notes section documents that root route is handled separately in PHASE1-015
6. **File Structure**: ✓ File path structure (`src/routes/health.routes.ts`) is appropriate for Express.js structure
7. **Task Scope**: ✓ Task scope is appropriate - focused on route definition only

#### Detailed Comparison

##### Routes in Rails File

**Rails Implementation** (`routes.rb:4-5, 8`):

```ruby
# Health check endpoint
get 'health', to: 'health#show'

# Root endpoint
root 'health#show'
```

**Task Specification**:

- Create route file with GET `/health` route
- Import `getHealth` function from controller
- Export router

**Comparison**:

- ✓ Route path `/health` matches Rails `'health'`
- ✓ HTTP method GET matches Rails `get`
- ✓ Controller function name `getHealth` correctly specified (matches PHASE1-013)
- ✓ Root route documented in Notes section (handled separately in PHASE1-015)

##### Dependencies

- **Express Router**: Required for route definition
- **Health Controller**: `getHealth` function from `src/controllers/health.controller.ts` (created in PHASE1-013)
- **Task Coverage**: ✓ Fully covered - checklist item 17 specifies importing `getHealth` function

##### Route Structure

- **Rails**: Route defined in `routes.rb` using `get 'health', to: 'health#show'`
- **Express**: Route defined in separate route file using `router.get('/health', getHealth)`
- **Task Coverage**: ✓ Structure is correct and handler specification is explicit in checklist item 19

##### Related Components

- **Controller**: Created in PHASE1-013 (`health.controller.ts` with `getHealth` function)
- **Route Registration**: Handled in PHASE1-015 (registering route in main app)
- **Task Coverage**: ✓ Task correctly focuses only on route definition

#### Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **VALIDATED** - Task is accurate and complete

All checklist items correctly match the Rails implementation:

- ✓ Correct route path (`/health` matches Rails `'health'`)
- ✓ Correct HTTP method (GET matches Rails `get`)
- ✓ Controller function name explicitly specified (`getHealth`)
- ✓ Route handler pattern explicitly specified (`router.get('/health', getHealth)`)
- ✓ Rails reference included in description
- ✓ Root route documented in Notes section
- ✓ File structure and naming conventions appropriate for TypeScript/Express.js

The task is ready for implementation.

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 5. Health Check Endpoint
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/config/routes.rb` (lines 4-5, 8)
- **Controller Reference**: Uses `getHealth` function from `src/controllers/health.controller.ts` (created in PHASE1-013)
- **Note**: In Rails, the health endpoint also serves as the root route (`GET /`). Root route registration will be handled in PHASE1-015 when registering routes in the main app.

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
