# PHASE1-003: Install TypeScript dependencies

**Section**: 1. Project Initialization
**Subsection**: 1.3
**Task ID**: PHASE1-003

## Description

Install TypeScript dependencies and create TypeScript configuration file. This task sets up the essential TypeScript tooling needed for development, including the TypeScript compiler, Node.js type definitions, and development tools for running TypeScript files directly.

## Checklist

- [x] Install `typescript` as dev dependency (TypeScript compiler) - ✅ Installed version 5.9.3
- [x] Install `@types/node` as dev dependency (TypeScript type definitions for Node.js) - ✅ Installed version 20.19.25
- [x] Install `ts-node` as dev dependency (TypeScript execution engine for Node.js, allows running .ts files directly) - ✅ Installed version 10.9.2
- [x] Install `nodemon` as dev dependency (Development tool that automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected) - ✅ Installed version 3.1.11
- [x] Create `tsconfig.json` file in project root with appropriate TypeScript compiler configuration - ✅ File exists
- [x] Configure `tsconfig.json` with essential settings:
  - Set `target` to `ES2022` or later - ✅ ES2022
  - Set `module` to `commonjs` - ✅ commonjs
  - Set `outDir` to `./dist` (build output directory) - ✅ ./dist
  - Set `rootDir` to `./src` (source directory) - ✅ ./src
  - Enable `strict` mode for type safety - ✅ true
  - Set `moduleResolution` to `node` - ✅ node
  - Enable `esModuleInterop` and `skipLibCheck` - ✅ Both enabled
  - Include `src/**/*` in compilation - ✅ Configured
  - Exclude `node_modules`, `dist`, and test files - ✅ Configured
- [x] Verify all packages installed correctly by running `npx tsc --version` - ✅ TypeScript 5.9.3 verified

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
