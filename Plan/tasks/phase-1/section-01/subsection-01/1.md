- [ ] Set `description` field to "Telegram webhook receiver that forwards messages to Cursor Runner API"
- [ ] Set `main` field to "dist/index.js"
- [ ] Set `scripts` object (empty initially, will be populated in later tasks)
- [ ] Set `keywords` array to ["telegram", "webhook", "bot", "cursor-runner", "typescript", "nodejs"]
- [ ] Set `author` field (optional, can be left empty)
- [ ] Set `license` field to "MIT"
- [ ] Set `engines` field (optional, can specify Node.js and npm version requirements, e.g., `{"node": ">=18.0.0", "npm": ">=9.0.0"}`)
- [ ] Note: `dependencies` and `devDependencies` will be added in later tasks as needed

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
