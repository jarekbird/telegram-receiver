# PHASE1-002: Initialize Git repository (if not exists)

**Section**: 1. Project Initialization
**Subsection**: 1.2
**Task ID**: PHASE1-002

## Description

Initialize Git repository for the telegram-receiver project if it doesn't already exist, and create or validate the `.gitignore` file with essential entries for a Node.js/TypeScript project. If the Git repository already exists, verify it's properly initialized. If `.gitignore` already exists, validate that it includes the required entries and add any missing ones.

## Checklist

- [ ] Check if `.git` directory exists
- [ ] If not, run `git init` to initialize the repository
- [ ] If Git repository exists, verify it's properly initialized (e.g., run `git status` to confirm)
- [ ] Check if `.gitignore` file exists
- [ ] If `.gitignore` doesn't exist, create it
- [ ] If `.gitignore` exists, validate it contains required entries (add missing ones)
- [ ] Ensure `node_modules/` is in `.gitignore` (dependencies directory)
- [ ] Ensure `dist/` is in `.gitignore` (TypeScript build output)
- [ ] Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (environment variables)
- [ ] Ensure `*.log` is in `.gitignore` (log files)
- [ ] Ensure `coverage/` is in `.gitignore` (test coverage reports)
- [ ] Optionally add common additional entries if not present: `.DS_Store` (macOS), `.vscode/` or `.idea/` (IDE), `*.tsbuildinfo` (TypeScript build info)
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` file is properly formatted and all entries are correct

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
