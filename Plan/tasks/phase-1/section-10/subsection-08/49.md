# PHASE1-049: Verify test coverage configuration

**Section**: 10. Test Suite Setup
**Subsection**: 10.8
**Task ID**: PHASE1-049

## Description

Verify that test coverage is properly configured and working. This task validates the coverage configuration set up in PHASE1-043 (Jest configuration) and PHASE1-046 (test scripts). The coverage configuration should match the requirements: collect coverage from source files, generate reports in multiple formats (text, lcov, HTML), and store them in the coverage directory.

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify `jest.config.ts` exists and contains coverage configuration
- [ ] Verify `collectCoverageFrom` includes `src/**/*.ts` and excludes test files and type definitions
- [ ] Verify `coverageDirectory` is set to `'coverage'`
- [ ] Verify `coverageReporters` array includes `['text', 'lcov', 'html']`
- [ ] Verify `package.json` contains `"test:coverage": "jest --coverage"` script
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage` and verify it executes without errors
- [ ] Verify coverage report is generated in the `coverage/` directory
- [ ] Verify `coverage/` directory contains HTML report files (index.html, base.css, etc.)
- [ ] Verify `coverage/` directory contains `lcov.info` file (for CI/CD integration)
- [ ] Verify `coverage/` directory is listed in `.gitignore` (should be ignored from version control)
- [ ] Open `coverage/index.html` in a browser and verify it displays coverage report correctly

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 10. Test Suite Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **This is a verification task** - coverage configuration is set up in PHASE1-043 (Jest configuration) and PHASE1-046 (test scripts)
- This task validates that coverage is properly configured and generates reports correctly
- The coverage configuration replaces any test coverage setup that would have been in Rails (RSpec with SimpleCov or similar)
- Coverage reports are generated in multiple formats:
  - **text**: Console output showing coverage percentages
  - **lcov**: Machine-readable format for CI/CD integration (coverage/lcov.info)
  - **html**: Human-readable HTML report for viewing in browser (coverage/index.html)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
