# PHASE1-049: Verify test coverage configuration

**Section**: 10. Test Suite Setup
**Subsection**: 10.8
**Task ID**: PHASE1-049

## Description

Verify that test coverage is properly configured and working. This task validates the coverage configuration set up in PHASE1-043 (Jest configuration) and PHASE1-046 (test scripts). The coverage configuration should match the requirements: collect coverage from source files, generate reports in multiple formats (text, lcov, HTML), and store them in the coverage directory.

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify `jest.config.ts` exists and contains coverage configuration
- [ ] Verify `collectCoverageFrom` includes `src/**/*.ts` and excludes test files and type definitions
- [ ] Verify `coverageDirectory` is set to `'coverage'`
- [ ] Verify `coverageReporters` array includes `['text', 'lcov', 'html']`
- [ ] Verify `package.json` contains `"test:coverage": "jest --coverage"` script
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage` and verify it executes without errors
- [ ] Verify coverage report is generated in the `coverage/` directory
- [ ] Verify `coverage/` directory contains HTML report files (index.html, base.css, etc.)
- [ ] Verify `coverage/` directory contains `lcov.info` file (for CI/CD integration)
- [ ] Verify `coverage/` directory is listed in `.gitignore` (should be ignored from version control)
- [ ] Open `coverage/index.html` in a browser and verify it displays coverage report correctly

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 10. Test Suite Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **This is a verification task** - coverage configuration is set up in PHASE1-043 (Jest configuration) and PHASE1-046 (test scripts)
- This task validates that coverage is properly configured and generates reports correctly
- The coverage configuration replaces any test coverage setup that would have been in Rails (RSpec with SimpleCov or similar)
- Coverage reports are generated in multiple formats:
  - **text**: Console output showing coverage percentages
  - **lcov**: Machine-readable format for CI/CD integration (coverage/lcov.info)
  - **html**: Human-readable HTML report for viewing in browser (coverage/index.html)

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
