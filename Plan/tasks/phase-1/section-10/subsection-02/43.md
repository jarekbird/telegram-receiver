# PHASE1-043: Create Jest configuration file

**Section**: 10. Test Suite Setup
**Subsection**: 10.2
**Task ID**: PHASE1-043

## Description

Create Jest configuration file (`jest.config.ts`) for the TypeScript/Node.js application. This configuration sets up Jest as the test runner, replacing RSpec from the Rails application. The configuration should support TypeScript testing, code coverage collection, and proper test file discovery.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `jest.config.ts` file (TypeScript configuration file, not `.js`)
- [ ] Set `preset` to 'ts-jest' (enables TypeScript support)
- [ ] Set `testEnvironment` to 'node' (Node.js environment, not browser)
- [ ] Set `roots` to ['<rootDir>/tests'] (test files are in tests directory, not src)
- [ ] Set `testMatch` pattern to `['**/__tests__/**/*.ts', '**/?(*.)+(spec|test).ts']` (matches test files)
- [ ] Configure `transform` for TypeScript files: `{ '^.+\\.ts$': 'ts-jest' }`
- [ ] Set `collectCoverageFrom` patterns to include `src/**/*.ts` and exclude test files and type definitions
- [ ] Set `coverageDirectory` to 'coverage'
- [ ] Set `coverageReporters` array to `['text', 'lcov', 'html']` (text for console, lcov for CI, html for viewing)
- [ ] Set `moduleFileExtensions` array to `['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'json', 'node']`
- [ ] Set `setupFilesAfterEnv` to `['<rootDir>/tests/setup.ts']` (runs before each test file)
- [ ] Set `testTimeout` to 10000 (10 seconds, allows for async operations)
- [ ] Set `verbose` to true (detailed test output)
- [ ] Configure `moduleNameMapper` for path aliases: `{ '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1' }` (supports @/ imports)
- [ ] Set `passWithNoTests` to true (allows tests to pass when no test files found during initial setup)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 10. Test Suite Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- The Jest configuration replaces RSpec configuration from Rails (`spec/spec_helper.rb` and `spec/rails_helper.rb`)
- Unlike RSpec which uses Ruby conventions, Jest uses JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
- The configuration should use TypeScript (`jest.config.ts`) for type safety
- Test files should be in the `tests/` directory, separate from source code in `src/`
- The `moduleNameMapper` enables path aliases (e.g., `@/services/telegram` instead of relative paths)

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
