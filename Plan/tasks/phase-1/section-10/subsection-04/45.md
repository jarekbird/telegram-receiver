# PHASE1-045: Install testing utilities

**Section**: 10. Test Suite Setup
**Subsection**: 10.4
**Task ID**: PHASE1-045

## Description

Install and verify testing utilities for the Node.js/TypeScript test suite. These utilities provide equivalent functionality to the Rails testing stack:

- `supertest` - HTTP endpoint testing (equivalent to RSpec Rails controller tests)
- `nock` - HTTP request mocking (equivalent to RSpec HTTP mocking patterns)
- `sinon` - Spies, stubs, and mocks (equivalent to RSpec's `allow`/`expect` mocking)

## Checklist

- [x] Verify `supertest` is installed as dev dependency (for HTTP endpoint testing)
- [x] Verify `@types/supertest` is installed as dev dependency
- [x] Verify `nock` is installed as dev dependency (for HTTP mocking)
- [x] Verify `sinon` is installed as dev dependency (for spies/stubs)
- [x] Verify `@types/sinon` is installed as dev dependency
- [x] If any utilities are missing, install them using `npm install --save-dev <package>`

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 10. Test Suite Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All utilities are installed and verified (supertest@6.3.3, nock@13.4.0, sinon@17.0.1, @types/supertest@2.0.16, @types/sinon@17.0.2). All packages are functional and can be required successfully.
- These utilities match the testing patterns used in the Rails jarek-va application:
  - Rails RSpec controller tests → Node.js Supertest
  - Rails HTTP mocking (Net::HTTP doubles) → Node.js Nock
  - Rails RSpec spies/stubs (`allow`, `expect`) → Node.js Sinon

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
