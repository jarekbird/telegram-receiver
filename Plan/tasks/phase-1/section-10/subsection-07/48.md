# PHASE1-048: Create health endpoint integration test

**Section**: 10. Test Suite Setup
**Subsection**: 10.7
**Task ID**: PHASE1-048

## Description

Create health endpoint integration test using Supertest to verify the health endpoint returns the correct response format matching the Rails implementation. This task creates an automated integration test that validates the health endpoint implementation from PHASE1-013, PHASE1-014, and PHASE1-015.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/health_controller.rb` (for expected response format)

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `tests/integration/api/health.test.ts` file
- [ ] Import app from `../../../src/index` (or appropriate app export path)
- [ ] Import `request` from `supertest` (use: `import request from 'supertest'`)
- [ ] Write test suite using `describe('Health Endpoint', ...)`
- [ ] Write test for GET `/health` endpoint
- [ ] Verify response status is 200
- [ ] Verify response body is JSON with:
  - `status: "healthy"` (must match Rails implementation, not "ok")
  - `service: string` (should be `'Virtual Assistant API'` or value from `APP_NAME` env var)
  - `version: string` (should be `'1.0.0'` or value from `APP_VERSION` env var)
- [ ] Write test for GET `/` (root route) endpoint
- [ ] Verify root route returns same health response as `/health`
- [ ] Run test and verify it passes

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 10. Test Suite Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/health_controller.rb` (for expected response format)
- **Previous Tasks**: This task tests the implementation from PHASE1-013 (controller), PHASE1-014 (route), and PHASE1-015 (route registration)
- **Expected Response Format**: The health endpoint should return:

  ```json
  {
    "status": "healthy",
    "service": "Virtual Assistant API",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
  ```

  - Note: Status must be `"healthy"` (not `"ok"`) to match Rails implementation
  - `service` and `version` may come from `APP_NAME` and `APP_VERSION` environment variables

- **Routes to Test**: Both `/health` and `/` (root) routes should be tested, as Rails has both routes pointing to the same controller
- **Test Location**: Integration tests for API endpoints should be placed in `tests/integration/api/` directory

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
