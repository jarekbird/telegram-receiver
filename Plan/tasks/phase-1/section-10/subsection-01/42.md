# PHASE1-042: Install Jest dependencies

**Section**: 10. Test Suite Setup
**Subsection**: 10.1
**Task ID**: PHASE1-042

## Description

Install and verify Jest dependencies for the test suite. Jest is the testing framework used for unit and integration tests in the Node.js/TypeScript application (equivalent to RSpec in the Rails jarek-va application).

## Checklist

- [ ] Check if `jest` is already installed in `package.json` (may already be present)
- [ ] Install `jest` as dev dependency if not already installed: `npm install --save-dev jest`
- [ ] Check if `@types/jest` is already installed in `package.json` (may already be present)
- [ ] Install `@types/jest` as dev dependency if not already installed: `npm install --save-dev @types/jest`
- [ ] Check if `ts-jest` is already installed in `package.json` (may already be present)
- [ ] Install `ts-jest` as dev dependency if not already installed: `npm install --save-dev ts-jest`
- [ ] Verify all packages are listed in `package.json` devDependencies section
- [ ] Run `npm list jest @types/jest ts-jest` to confirm installation

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 10. Test Suite Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Current State**: As of validation, Jest dependencies (`jest`, `@types/jest`, `ts-jest`) are already installed in `package.json` devDependencies. The task should verify installation and install only if missing.
- Jest replaces RSpec (used in jarek-va Rails app) for the Node.js/TypeScript test suite
- Required packages:
  - `jest`: Testing framework
  - `@types/jest`: TypeScript type definitions for Jest
  - `ts-jest`: TypeScript preprocessor for Jest to handle TypeScript files

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
