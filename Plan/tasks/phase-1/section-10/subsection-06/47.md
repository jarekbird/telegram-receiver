# PHASE1-047: Create sample unit test

**Section**: 10. Test Suite Setup
**Subsection**: 10.6
**Task ID**: PHASE1-047

## Description

Create a sample unit test file to verify that the Jest test infrastructure is properly configured and working. This test serves as a smoke test to ensure that:

- Jest can discover and run test files
- TypeScript compilation works correctly in the test environment
- The test setup file (`tests/setup.ts`) is loaded properly
- Test output appears correctly in the console

This is a simple "hello world" style test that always passes, intended to validate the test framework setup rather than test actual application code.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `tests/unit/utils/example.test.ts` file
- [ ] Write a simple test using Jest's `describe` and `it` functions
- [ ] Include a basic assertion that always passes (e.g., `expect(true).toBe(true)` or `expect(1 + 1).toBe(2)`)
- [ ] Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) as documented in `tests/README.md`
- [ ] Verify the test file follows TypeScript conventions and imports
- [ ] Run `npm test` and verify the test executes successfully
- [ ] Verify the test appears in Jest's output with proper formatting
- [ ] Verify no errors or warnings appear in the test output
- [ ] Optionally run `npm run test:unit` to verify it filters correctly

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 10. Test Suite Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- This is a setup/verification task, not a conversion task - it validates that the Jest configuration from previous tasks (PHASE1-042 through PHASE1-046) is working correctly
- The test should be simple and always pass - its purpose is to verify test infrastructure, not to test application logic
- The file path `tests/unit/utils/example.test.ts` follows the test directory structure documented in `tests/README.md`
- Jest configuration expects test files matching `**/?(*.)+(spec|test).ts` pattern (see `jest.config.ts`)
- The test setup file (`tests/setup.ts`) will be automatically loaded before tests run

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
