# PHASE1-047: Create sample unit test

**Section**: 10. Test Suite Setup
**Subsection**: 10.6
**Task ID**: PHASE1-047

## Description

Create a sample unit test file to verify that the Jest test infrastructure is properly configured and working. This test serves as a smoke test to ensure that:

- Jest can discover and run test files
- TypeScript compilation works correctly in the test environment
- The test setup file (`tests/setup.ts`) is loaded properly
- Test output appears correctly in the console

This is a simple "hello world" style test that always passes, intended to validate the test framework setup rather than test actual application code.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `tests/unit/utils/example.test.ts` file
- [ ] Write a simple test using Jest's `describe` and `it` functions
- [ ] Include a basic assertion that always passes (e.g., `expect(true).toBe(true)` or `expect(1 + 1).toBe(2)`)
- [ ] Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) as documented in `tests/README.md`
- [ ] Verify the test file follows TypeScript conventions and imports
- [ ] Run `npm test` and verify the test executes successfully
- [ ] Verify the test appears in Jest's output with proper formatting
- [ ] Verify no errors or warnings appear in the test output
- [ ] Optionally run `npm run test:unit` to verify it filters correctly

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 10. Test Suite Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- This is a setup/verification task, not a conversion task - it validates that the Jest configuration from previous tasks (PHASE1-042 through PHASE1-046) is working correctly
- The test should be simple and always pass - its purpose is to verify test infrastructure, not to test application logic
- The file path `tests/unit/utils/example.test.ts` follows the test directory structure documented in `tests/README.md`
- Jest configuration expects test files matching `**/?(*.)+(spec|test).ts` pattern (see `jest.config.ts`)
- The test setup file (`tests/setup.ts`) will be automatically loaded before tests run

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
