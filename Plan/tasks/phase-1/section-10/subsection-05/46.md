# PHASE1-046: Add test scripts to package.json

**Section**: 10. Test Suite Setup
**Subsection**: 10.5
**Task ID**: PHASE1-046

## Description

Ensure test scripts are present in package.json. These scripts provide convenient commands for running tests in different modes (standard, watch mode, coverage, unit tests, and integration tests).

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify `package.json` exists in the project root
- [ ] Check if `"test": "jest"` exists in scripts section; add if missing
- [ ] Check if `"test:watch": "jest --watch"` exists in scripts section; add if missing
- [ ] Check if `"test:coverage": "jest --coverage"` exists in scripts section; add if missing
- [ ] Check if `"test:unit": "jest --testPathPattern=tests/unit"` exists in scripts section; add if missing
- [ ] Check if `"test:integration": "jest --testPathPattern=tests/integration"` exists in scripts section; add if missing
- [ ] Verify all scripts are correctly formatted JSON (no trailing commas, proper quotes)
- [ ] Test that `npm run test` executes without errors

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 10. Test Suite Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Verification Note**: As of task validation, all required test scripts already exist in `package.json`. The task should verify their presence and ensure they match the expected values. If scripts already exist and are correct, the task can be marked as complete after verification.
- These scripts require Jest to be installed as a dev dependency (should be verified in a previous task)
- The `test:unit` and `test:integration` scripts use `--testPathPattern` to filter tests by directory structure

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
