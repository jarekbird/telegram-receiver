# PHASE1-012: Add build scripts to package.json

**Section**: 4. Express.js Framework Setup
**Subsection**: 4.4
**Task ID**: PHASE1-012

## Description

Add build scripts to package.json to enable TypeScript compilation and application execution. These scripts provide the Node.js/TypeScript equivalent of Rails build and run commands, enabling developers to compile TypeScript code, run the application in development mode with hot reload, and start the production server.

**Rails Equivalent**: Rails uses `make run` (which runs `rails server`) for development and Puma configuration for production. This task sets up the equivalent npm scripts for the TypeScript/Node.js application.

## Checklist

- [ ] Add `"build": "tsc"` to scripts (compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in `dist/` directory)
- [ ] Add `"build:watch": "tsc --watch"` to scripts (watches for TypeScript file changes and recompiles automatically)
- [ ] Add `"dev": "nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts"` to scripts (runs application in development mode with hot reload, equivalent to `rails server` in development)
- [ ] Add `"start": "node dist/index.js"` to scripts (runs compiled JavaScript in production mode, requires `npm run build` first)
- [ ] Verify scripts are valid JSON syntax
- [ ] Ensure scripts section exists in package.json (create if missing)

## Implementation Notes

### Rails Equivalent Commands

- **Rails**: `make run` → `rails server` (development server on port 3000)
- **Node.js**: `npm run dev` → runs with nodemon and ts-node for hot reload (for Docker deployment only, not manual testing)

- **Rails**: `rails server -e production` (production mode)
- **Node.js**: `npm run build && npm start` → compiles then runs production build (for deployment only, not manual testing)

**Important**: These scripts are for deployment purposes only. Developers should use automated tests (`npm test`, `npm run test:integration`) instead of running the server manually for testing.

### Script Purposes

- **`build`**: Compiles TypeScript source files (`src/**/*.ts`) to JavaScript in the `dist/` directory using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). This is required before running in production.
- **`build:watch`**: Continuously watches TypeScript files for changes and automatically recompiles. Useful for development when you want to ensure compiled output stays in sync.
- **`dev`**: Runs the application in development mode using `nodemon` (watches for file changes) and `ts-node` (executes TypeScript directly without compilation). Equivalent to Rails development server with auto-reload. **Note**: This is for Docker deployment only, not for manual testing.
- **`start`**: Runs the compiled JavaScript application from the `dist/` directory. This is the production entry point and requires the application to be built first. **Note**: This is for deployment only, not for manual testing.

### Prerequisites

- TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) must be installed (typically in `devDependencies`)
- `ts-node` must be installed for the `dev` script
- `nodemon` must be installed for the `dev` script
- `src/index.ts` must exist (created in PHASE1-011)

### TypeScript Configuration

- Scripts assume `tsconfig.json` is configured with:
  - `outDir: "./dist"` (output directory)
  - `rootDir: "./src"` (source directory)
- The `build` script uses the TypeScript compiler configuration from `tsconfig.json`

## Validation Report

### Task Review: PHASE1-012

#### Task Information

- **Task ID**: PHASE1-012
- **Task Title**: Add build scripts to package.json
- **Task Type**: Infrastructure Setup (not a direct Rails code conversion)

#### Validation Results

##### ✓ Correct

- All requested scripts are appropriate for a TypeScript/Node.js project
- Script commands are correct and follow Node.js/TypeScript best practices
- Scripts enable equivalent functionality to Rails development workflow:
  - `npm run dev` ≈ `rails server` (development with hot reload)
  - `npm run build && npm start` ≈ `rails server -e production` (production)
- Checklist items are clear and actionable

##### ℹ️ Current Status

- **Note**: All requested scripts are already present in `package.json`:
  - `"build": "tsc"` ✓ (line 7)
  - `"build:watch": "tsc --watch"` ✓ (line 8)
  - `"dev": "nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts"` ✓ (line 9)
  - `"start": "node dist/index.js"` ✓ (line 10)
- The task appears to be already completed, but the task description lacked context about Rails equivalents and implementation details

##### 📝 Enhancements Made

1. **Enhanced Description**: Added context about Rails equivalents and purpose of each script
2. **Added Implementation Notes**: Included detailed explanation of each script's purpose, Rails equivalents, prerequisites, and TypeScript configuration requirements
3. **Added Validation Report**: Documented current status and validation results

##### Script Validation

All scripts match TypeScript/Node.js best practices:

- `build`: Standard TypeScript compilation command ✓
- `build:watch`: Standard watch mode for continuous compilation ✓
- `dev`: Appropriate development setup with nodemon and ts-node ✓
- `start`: Standard production entry point ✓

#### Comparison with Rails Workflow

**Rails Development**:

```bash
make run          # → rails server (development, port 3000)
```

**Node.js Development** (after this task):

```bash
npm run dev       # → nodemon + ts-node (development, hot reload) - for Docker deployment only
```

**Rails Production**:

```bash
rails server -e production  # → Puma server (production mode)
```

**Node.js Production** (after this task):

```bash
npm run build     # → Compile TypeScript
npm start         # → Run compiled JavaScript - for deployment only
```

**Important**: These scripts are for deployment purposes only. For testing, use automated tests:

```bash
npm test          # → Run all tests
npm run test:integration  # → Run integration tests
```

The scripts provide equivalent functionality to Rails development and production workflows.

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 4. Express.js Framework Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Prerequisites**: `src/index.ts` must exist (created in PHASE1-011)
- **Dependencies**: Requires `typescript`, `ts-node`, and `nodemon` packages (should be in `devDependencies`)
- **Note**: This is an infrastructure setup task that doesn't directly convert Rails code, but establishes the build/run workflow equivalent to Rails' `make run` and Puma server configuration

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
