# PHASE1-011: Create application entry point

**Section**: 4. Express.js Framework Setup
**Subsection**: 4.3
**Task ID**: PHASE1-011

## Description

Create the application entry point in `src/index.ts`. This file serves as the main entry point for the Node.js application, similar to `config.ru` in Rails. It imports the Express app instance (created in PHASE1-010), starts the HTTP server, and handles server lifecycle events including graceful shutdown.

The entry point should:

- Import the Express app instance from `src/app.ts`
- Read port and host configuration from environment variables (defaulting to PORT=3000 and HOST='0.0.0.0', matching Rails Puma defaults)
- Start the HTTP server and log startup information (port, environment, etc.)
- Handle server startup errors (e.g., port already in use, permission denied)
- Implement graceful shutdown handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT signals
- Handle uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections
- Ensure proper cleanup on shutdown

## Checklist

- [ ] Open `src/index.ts` file (create if it doesn't exist)
- [ ] Import Express app instance from `./app`
- [ ] Import environment variables (use `process.env` directly or import from a config module if one exists)
- [ ] Define port constant (default: `process.env.PORT || 3000`, matching Rails default)
- [ ] Define host constant (default: `process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0'`, matching Rails Puma default)
- [ ] Create `startServer()` function that:
  - Creates HTTP server from Express app
  - Starts listening on the configured port and host
  - Logs startup information (port, environment, app name/version if available)
  - Handles server startup errors (EADDRINUSE, EACCES, etc.)
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown handler:
  - Listen for SIGTERM and SIGINT signals
  - Close server gracefully (stop accepting new connections, wait for existing requests to complete)
  - Exit process with appropriate code
- [ ] Add global error handlers:
  - Handle uncaught exceptions
  - Handle unhandled promise rejections
  - Log errors appropriately
- [ ] Call `startServer()` function to start the application
- [ ] Ensure proper TypeScript types are used

## Implementation Notes

### Rails Equivalent

- Rails uses `config.ru` (Rack entry point) which calls `Rails.application.load_server`
- Server configuration is in `config/puma.rb` with defaults: PORT=3000, environment from RAILS_ENV
- Rails automatically handles graceful shutdown via Puma

### Node.js/Express Best Practices

- Use `app.listen(port, host, callback)` to start the server
- Handle `EADDRINUSE` error (port already in use) with a clear error message
- Handle `EACCES` error (permission denied) with a clear error message
- Implement graceful shutdown to allow in-flight requests to complete
- Set a timeout for graceful shutdown (e.g., 10 seconds) before force exit
- Log server startup information for debugging and monitoring

### Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000, matching Rails)
- `HOST`: Server host (default: '0.0.0.0', matching Rails Puma)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development, test, production)

### Error Handling

- Server startup errors should be caught and logged with clear messages
- Uncaught exceptions should be logged and the process should exit
- Unhandled promise rejections should be logged and the process should exit
- Graceful shutdown should handle cleanup of resources (database connections, Redis connections, etc.)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 4. Express.js Framework Setup
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- The Express app instance must be created first (PHASE1-010)
- Environment configuration can be handled via `process.env` directly or through a config module (to be created in a later task)

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
