# PHASE1-024: Create environment configuration module

**Section**: 7. Environment Variables Management
**Subsection**: 7.2
**Task ID**: PHASE1-024

## Description

Create an environment configuration module that loads environment variables from `.env` files and provides a centralized configuration object. This module is the Node.js/TypeScript equivalent of the Rails `config/application.rb` file, which uses `ENV.fetch()` to access environment variables throughout the application.

The Rails application (`jarek-va/config/application.rb`) uses `dotenv-rails` (automatically loaded via Gemfile) to load environment variables from `.env` files. The Rails app accesses environment variables using `ENV.fetch()` with default values throughout the codebase. This task creates the foundational environment configuration module that will be extended in later tasks as more environment variables are needed.

**Rails Equivalent**: `config/application.rb` (jarek-va/config/application.rb) - specifically the environment variable access patterns using `ENV.fetch()` with defaults

**Note**: This task creates the basic environment configuration module with only `NODE_ENV` and `PORT`. Additional environment variables (such as `CURSOR_RUNNER_URL`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, etc.) will be added in later tasks as the corresponding features are implemented.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/config/environment.ts` file
- [ ] Import `dotenv` module
- [ ] Call `dotenv.config()` to load `.env` file from project root (dotenv automatically looks for `.env` in current working directory)
- [ ] Create TypeScript interface/type for the config object structure
- [ ] Create `config` object with proper typing
- [ ] Add `env` property from `process.env.NODE_ENV` or default to "development" (matching Rails `Rails.env` behavior)
- [ ] Add `port` property from `process.env.PORT` or default to 3000 (matching Rails `config/puma.rb` port configuration)
- [ ] Ensure `port` is converted to number type
- [ ] Export `config` object as default export
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments documenting the module and config properties

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 7. Environment Variables Management
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Rails equivalent: `config/application.rb` (jarek-va/config/application.rb) and `config/puma.rb` (jarek-va/config/puma.rb)
- The Rails application uses `ENV.fetch()` throughout to access environment variables with defaults (e.g., `ENV.fetch('PORT') { 3000 }`)
- Rails uses `dotenv-rails` gem which automatically loads `.env` files (see jarek-va/Gemfile line 21)
- In Node.js, `dotenv.config()` by default looks for `.env` in the current working directory (project root)
- The Rails app has many more environment variables (see jarek-va/config/application.rb), but those will be added in later tasks as features are implemented
- This module provides the foundation for accessing environment variables throughout the application, similar to how Rails uses `Rails.application.config` and `ENV.fetch()`

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
