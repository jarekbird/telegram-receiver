# PHASE1-023: Install dotenv package

**Section**: 7. Environment Variables Management
**Subsection**: 7.1
**Task ID**: PHASE1-023

## Description

Install the `dotenv` package to enable loading environment variables from `.env` files. This is the Node.js equivalent of the `dotenv-rails` gem used in the jarek-va Rails application.

The jarek-va Rails application uses `dotenv-rails` (see `jarek-va/Gemfile` line 21) to automatically load environment variables from `.env` files during development and testing. The Node.js equivalent is the `dotenv` package, which provides similar functionality for loading environment variables from `.env` files into `process.env`.

**Rails Equivalent**: `dotenv-rails` gem (jarek-va/Gemfile)

**Note**: This task only installs the package. Configuration and usage of dotenv will be implemented in PHASE1-024 (Create environment configuration module).

## Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm install dotenv` to install as production dependency (or verify if already installed)
- [ ] Verify `dotenv` appears in `package.json` dependencies section
- [ ] Verify installation by checking `node_modules/dotenv` exists
- [ ] Verify `dotenv` version matches or exceeds the version in `package.json` (currently ^16.3.1)
- [ ] Note that configuration will be done in PHASE1-024

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 7. Environment Variables Management
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Rails equivalent: `dotenv-rails` gem (jarek-va/Gemfile line 21, version ~> 2.8)
- The Rails application uses `ENV.fetch()` throughout to access environment variables (see jarek-va/config/application.rb)
- Configuration and usage of dotenv will be implemented in the next task (PHASE1-024)
- **Note**: If `dotenv` is already installed in `package.json`, the `npm install` step is idempotent and can be skipped; proceed directly to verification steps

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
