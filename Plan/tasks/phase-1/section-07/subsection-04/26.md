# PHASE1-026: Create .env.development file

**Section**: 7. Environment Variables Management
**Subsection**: 7.4
**Task ID**: PHASE1-026

## Description

Create a `.env.development` file that contains development-specific environment variable values. This file is used during local development and should contain safe, non-production values suitable for development work.

This task creates the `.env.development` file by copying the template from `.env.example` (created in PHASE1-025) and setting appropriate development values. The file should use local development URLs (localhost), debug logging levels, and placeholder values for secrets that developers will replace with their own development credentials.

**Rails Equivalent**: Rails uses `RAILS_ENV=development` environment variable and development-specific configuration in `config/environments/development.rb`. The `.env.development` file serves a similar purpose by providing development-specific environment variable values.

**Note**: This task creates the `.env.development` file with development-appropriate values. Developers should customize the values (especially secrets and tokens) for their local development environment.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `.env.development` file in project root directory
- [ ] Copy all contents from `.env.example` file
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=development` (matches Rails `RAILS_ENV=development` behavior)
- [ ] Set `PORT=3000` (standard development port, matches Rails default)
- [ ] Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` (more verbose logging for development, matches Rails development logging)
- [ ] Set `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000` (local development URL)
- [ ] Set `CURSOR_RUNNER_URL=http://localhost:3001` (local development URL for cursor-runner service)
- [ ] Set `CURSOR_RUNNER_TIMEOUT=300` (copy from `.env.example`, matches Rails default timeout)
- [ ] Set `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379` (local Redis instance)
- [ ] Use placeholder values for secrets (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET, WEBHOOK_SECRET, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY)
- [ ] Add header comment indicating this is a development environment configuration file
- [ ] Ensure all values are safe for local development (no production secrets)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 7. Environment Variables Management
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Rails equivalent: Rails uses `RAILS_ENV=development` and development-specific configuration in `config/environments/development.rb` (see jarek-va/config/environments/development.rb)
- The `.env.development` file should never be committed to version control (should be in `.gitignore`)
- Developers should copy `.env.example` to `.env.development` and customize values for their local development environment
- Development values should use localhost URLs and debug logging levels for easier debugging
- Placeholder values for secrets allow developers to add their own development credentials without exposing real tokens

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
