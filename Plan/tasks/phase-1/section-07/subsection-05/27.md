# PHASE1-027: Create .env.test file

**Section**: 7. Environment Variables Management
**Subsection**: 7.5
**Task ID**: PHASE1-027

## Description

Create or update a `.env.test` file that contains test-specific environment variable values. This file is used during test execution and should contain values suitable for automated testing, including minimal logging, test-specific ports, and safe placeholder values for secrets.

This task creates or updates the `.env.test` file by copying the template from `.env.example` (created in PHASE1-025) and setting appropriate test values. The file should use test-specific URLs (localhost), error-level logging (to reduce test output noise), and placeholder values for secrets that are safe for test execution.

**Rails Equivalent**: Rails uses `RAILS_ENV=test` environment variable and test-specific configuration in `config/environments/test.rb`. The `.env.test` file serves a similar purpose by providing test-specific environment variable values.

**Note**: This task creates or updates the `.env.test` file with test-appropriate values. The test environment should use minimal logging, isolated database/Redis instances, and safe placeholder values for external service tokens. All environment variables from `.env.example` should be included with test-appropriate values.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create or update `.env.test` file in project root directory
- [ ] Copy all contents from `.env.example` file (includes TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET, TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL, CURSOR_RUNNER_URL, CURSOR_RUNNER_TIMEOUT, REDIS_URL, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY, WEBHOOK_SECRET, PORT, NODE_ENV)
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=test` (matches Rails `RAILS_ENV=test` behavior)
- [ ] Set `PORT=3001` (different from development port 3000 to avoid conflicts)
- [ ] Set `LOG_LEVEL=error` (minimal logging for tests, matches Rails test environment minimal logging - add this if not present in `.env.example`)
- [ ] Set `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001` (test-specific URL, matches test port)
- [ ] Set `CURSOR_RUNNER_URL=http://localhost:3001` (test-specific URL for cursor-runner service)
- [ ] Set `CURSOR_RUNNER_TIMEOUT=30` (shorter timeout for tests, matches Rails test environment faster timeouts)
- [ ] Set `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/1` (test-specific Redis database, isolated from development)
- [ ] Use test placeholder values for secrets:
  - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=test_bot_token`
  - `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=test_webhook_secret`
  - `WEBHOOK_SECRET=test_webhook_secret`
  - `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=` (empty, no real API key needed for tests)
- [ ] Add header comment indicating this is a test environment configuration file
- [ ] Ensure all values are safe for test execution (no production secrets, isolated resources)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 7. Environment Variables Management
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Rails equivalent: Rails uses `RAILS_ENV=test` and test-specific configuration in `config/environments/test.rb` (see jarek-va/config/environments/test.rb)
- The `.env.test` file should never be committed to version control (should be in `.gitignore`)
- Test values should use minimal logging (error level) to reduce test output noise
- Test environment should use isolated resources (different Redis database, different port) to avoid conflicts with development
- Placeholder values for secrets allow tests to run without requiring real external service credentials
- The test environment is used exclusively for running the test suite and should not be used for development work
- All environment variables from `.env.example` must be included in `.env.test` with test-appropriate values
- `CURSOR_RUNNER_TIMEOUT` should be set to a shorter value (30 seconds) for faster test execution

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
