# PHASE1-025: Create .env.example file

**Section**: 7. Environment Variables Management
**Subsection**: 7.3
**Task ID**: PHASE1-025

## Description

Create a `.env.example` file that serves as a template for environment variable configuration. This file documents all environment variables used by the application and provides placeholder values for developers to copy into their own `.env.development`, `.env.test`, or `.env.production` files.

This task creates the foundational `.env.example` file with the basic environment variables that are implemented in PHASE1-024 (NODE_ENV, PORT, LOG_LEVEL). Additional environment variables (such as TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, CURSOR_RUNNER_URL, REDIS_URL, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY, etc.) will be added in later tasks as the corresponding features are implemented.

**Rails Equivalent**: `.env.example` file (jarek-va/.env.example) - serves as a template for environment variable configuration

**Note**: This task creates the basic `.env.example` file with only the environment variables implemented in PHASE1-024. The file should be structured to allow easy addition of more variables in later tasks.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `.env.example` file in project root directory
- [ ] Add header comment explaining the file's purpose (template for environment variables)
- [ ] Add comment instructing users to copy to `.env.development`, `.env.test`, or `.env.production`
- [ ] Add "Application Environment" section comment
- [ ] Add `NODE_ENV=development` line (matches Rails `RAILS_ENV` behavior)
- [ ] Add `PORT=3000` line (matches Rails `config/puma.rb` port configuration)
- [ ] Add `LOG_LEVEL=info` line (matches Rails `config/application.rb` LOG_LEVEL configuration)
- [ ] Add comment sections for future environment variables (Telegram, Cursor Runner, Redis, ElevenLabs, etc.) with placeholder comments indicating they will be added in later tasks
- [ ] Ensure all placeholder values are safe defaults (no real secrets or tokens)
- [ ] Format file with clear sections and comments for maintainability

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 7. Environment Variables Management
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Rails equivalent: `.env.example` file (jarek-va/.env.example)
- The Rails application uses environment variables defined in `config/application.rb` (see jarek-va/config/application.rb)
- This task creates the basic `.env.example` with only NODE_ENV, PORT, and LOG_LEVEL (matching what's implemented in PHASE1-024)
- Additional environment variables will be added in later tasks as features are implemented:
  - Telegram configuration (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET, TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL, TELEGRAM_API_URL)
  - Cursor Runner configuration (CURSOR_RUNNER_URL, CURSOR_RUNNER_TIMEOUT)
  - Redis configuration (REDIS_URL)
  - ElevenLabs configuration (ELEVENLABS_API_KEY, ELEVENLABS_STT_MODEL_ID, ELEVENLABS_TTS_MODEL_ID, ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID)
  - Application metadata (APP_NAME, APP_VERSION)
- The `.env.example` file should never contain real secrets or production values - only safe placeholder values
- Developers should copy `.env.example` to `.env.development`, `.env.test`, or `.env.production` and fill in actual values

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
