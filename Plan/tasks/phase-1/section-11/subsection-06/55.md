# PHASE1-055: Configure CI job - Build

**Section**: 11. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
**Subsection**: 11.6
**Task ID**: PHASE1-055

## Description

Configure the build step for the CI test job in the GitHub Actions workflow. This task focuses on adding a build step that compiles TypeScript code to JavaScript, ensuring the project can be built successfully and validating that compilation produces the expected output artifacts. The build step should run after code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking) and before running tests, as it validates that the TypeScript code compiles without errors and generates the expected build artifacts.

**Reference Implementation**: While the Rails application (`jarek-va`) doesn't have a separate build workflow (build happens during deployment in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`), this task adds a build validation step to the CI workflow to catch compilation errors early.

## Checklist

### Build Step

- [ ] Add step to build the project using `npm run build` (which runs `tsc` to compile TypeScript)
- [ ] Place the build step after code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking) and before test execution
- [ ] Use descriptive step name like "Build TypeScript project" or "Compile TypeScript"

### Build Artifact Verification

- [ ] Add step to verify that the `dist/` directory exists after build
- [ ] Add step to verify that the main entry point exists (`dist/index.js` as defined in package.json)
- [ ] Optionally verify that source maps are generated (`dist/index.js.map` and other `.map` files)
- [ ] Optionally verify that declaration files are generated (`dist/index.d.ts` and other `.d.ts` files)
- [ ] Optionally verify that declaration maps are generated (`dist/index.d.ts.map` and other `.d.ts.map` files)

### Error Handling

- [ ] Ensure build step fails the workflow if compilation errors occur
- [ ] Build step should catch TypeScript type errors that weren't caught by `type-check` step

## Implementation Details

### Build Configuration

- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (defined in `package.json` as `"build": "tsc"`)
- **TypeScript Compiler**: Uses `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) configured via `tsconfig.json`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/` (configured in `tsconfig.json` as `"outDir": "./dist"`)
- **Source Directory**: `src/` (configured in `tsconfig.json` as `"rootDir": "./src"`)

### Build Output

According to `tsconfig.json`, the build process generates:

- Compiled JavaScript files (`.js`) in `dist/` directory
- Source maps (`.map` files) - enabled via `"sourceMap": true`
- Declaration files (`.d.ts`) - enabled via `"declaration": true`
- Declaration maps (`.d.ts.map`) - enabled via `"declarationMap": true`

### NPM Scripts Available

- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript project (runs `tsc`)
- `npm run build:watch` - Build in watch mode (not used in CI)

### Expected Workflow Structure

The build step should appear in this order (after setup and before tests):

1. Checkout code
2. Set up Node.js
3. Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
4. Run linting (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript type check)
5. **Build project (`npm run build`)** ← This task
6. Verify build artifacts (`dist/` directory exists)
7. Run tests

### Verification Commands

- Check if `dist/` directory exists: `test -d dist`
- Check if main entry point exists: `test -f dist/index.js` (main entry point as defined in package.json)
- Optionally check for other build artifacts: `test -f dist/index.js.map` (source map), `test -f dist/index.d.ts` (declaration file)
- List build artifacts: `ls -la dist/` (for debugging)

### Step Naming

- Use descriptive step names like:
  - "Build TypeScript project"
  - "Verify build artifacts"

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 11. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- This task adds build steps to the workflow file created in PHASE1-051 and configured in previous tasks
- The build step validates that TypeScript code compiles successfully, catching compilation errors early
- Building before tests ensures that test failures aren't due to compilation issues
- The build step complements the `type-check` step (from PHASE1-053) by actually compiling the code
- Type checking (`tsc --noEmit`) validates types without emitting files, while build (`tsc`) validates types AND generates output files

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
