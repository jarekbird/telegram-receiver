# PHASE1-053: Configure CI job - Linting

**Section**: 11. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
**Subsection**: 11.4
**Task ID**: PHASE1-053

## Description

Configure the linting and type checking steps for the CI test job in the GitHub Actions workflow. This task focuses on adding code quality checks including ESLint linting, Prettier format checking, and TypeScript type checking, mirroring the Rails CI workflow linting step (`jarek-va/.github/workflows/test.yml` lines 60-75) but adapted for Node.js/TypeScript tooling. The linting steps should use changed file detection to only lint changed files when possible, falling back to linting all files when no changes are detected.

## Reference Implementation

The Rails application (`jarek-va`) has a linting step in its CI workflow (lines 60-75) that includes:

- Changed file detection (from previous step, outputs `has_changes` and `changed_files`)
- Run RuboCop linter on changed source files (excluding spec files)
- Filter out test files (`spec/`) for linting - only lint source files (`app/`, `lib/`, etc.)
- Handle case when no source files changed after filtering (skip linting)
- Fallback to linting all files if no changes detected (`bundle exec rubocop`)
- Conditional execution based on `steps.changed-files.outputs.has_changes`

## Checklist

### ESLint Linting

- [ ] Add step to run ESLint linter using `npm run lint`
- [ ] Use changed file detection from previous step (if available)
- [ ] For changed files: run ESLint only on changed TypeScript files (filter to `.ts` files)
- [ ] Filter out test files (`tests/**/*.ts`) from linting when changed files are detected - only lint source files (`src/**/*.ts`) to match Rails workflow pattern (Rails filters out `spec/` files)
- [ ] If no source files changed after filtering: skip ESLint or run on all files (handle gracefully)
- [ ] If no changed files detected: run ESLint on all files (`npm run lint`)

### Prettier Format Checking

- [ ] Add step to run Prettier format check using `npm run format:check`
- [ ] Use changed file detection from previous step (if available)
- [ ] For changed files: run Prettier check only on changed TypeScript files
- [ ] If no changed files detected: run Prettier check on all files
- [ ] Prettier should check both source and test files (as configured in package.json)

### TypeScript Type Checking

- [ ] Add step to run TypeScript type checking using `npm run type-check` (preferred) or `tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] Type checking should run on all files (not just changed files) as TypeScript needs full project context
- [ ] This step validates that the entire codebase has no type errors

## Implementation Details

### NPM Scripts Available

- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint on src and tests directories (defined in package.json)
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint with auto-fix (not used in CI)
- `npm run format:check` - Check Prettier formatting on src and tests directories
- `npm run format` - Format files with Prettier (not used in CI)
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit)

### Changed File Detection

- The changed file detection step should be added in a previous task (PHASE1-051 or PHASE1-052)
- Changed files output should be available as `steps.changed-files.outputs.changed_files` (multiline string)
- Changed files detection should filter for `.ts` files using `grep -E '\.ts$'`
- The step should output `has_changes` (boolean) and `changed_files` (multiline string) to `GITHUB_OUTPUT`
- For pull requests: compare against `github.event.pull_request.base.sha`
- For pushes: compare against `HEAD~1`
- Reference Rails workflow lines 33-58 for the exact bash script pattern

### ESLint Configuration

- ESLint is configured in `.eslintrc.json`
- ESLint lints both `src/` and `tests/` directories (as per package.json `npm run lint` script)
- ESLint uses TypeScript parser and type-aware rules
- **Note**: In CI, when linting changed files, filter out test files to only lint source files (matching Rails RuboCop pattern which excludes spec files)

### Prettier Configuration

- Prettier checks formatting on `src/**/*.ts` and `tests/**/*.ts` (as per package.json script)
- Prettier is integrated with ESLint via `eslint-config-prettier` and `eslint-plugin-prettier`

### TypeScript Type Checking

- Type checking uses `tsc --noEmit` which compiles without emitting files
- Type checking validates the entire project (needs full project context)
- TypeScript configuration is in `tsconfig.json`
- Type checking should always run on all files, not just changed files

### Expected Workflow Structure

The linting steps should appear in this order (after setup and changed file detection):

1. Run ESLint linter (on changed files or all files)
2. Run Prettier format check (on changed files or all files)
3. Run TypeScript type checking (on all files)

### Implementation Pattern (matching Rails workflow)

The ESLint step should follow this pattern (similar to Rails RuboCop step at lines 60-75):

```yaml
- name: Run ESLint linter
  run: |
    if [ "${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.has_changes }}" == "true" ]; then
      echo "Linting changed files..."
      CHANGED_FILES="${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.changed_files }}"
      # Filter out test files (only lint source files, matching Rails pattern)
      SOURCE_FILES=$(echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -v '^tests/' || echo "")
      if [ -n "$SOURCE_FILES" ]; then
        # Run ESLint on all changed source files at once
        npx eslint $SOURCE_FILES
      else
        echo "No source files changed, skipping ESLint"
      fi
    else
      echo "No files changed, linting all files..."
      npm run lint
    fi
```

Similar pattern should be used for Prettier format checking (using `npx prettier --check` with filtered source files).

### Step Naming

- Use descriptive step names like:
  - "Run ESLint linter"
  - "Check Prettier formatting"
  - "Run TypeScript type check"

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 11. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- This task adds linting steps to the workflow file created in PHASE1-051 and configured in PHASE1-052
- The workflow should mirror the Rails CI workflow structure but use Node.js/TypeScript tooling
- ESLint and Prettier are already configured in the project (see `.eslintrc.json` and `package.json`)
- Type checking should run on all files as TypeScript requires full project context for accurate type checking

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
