# PHASE1-054: Configure CI job - Testing

**Section**: 11. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
**Subsection**: 11.5
**Task ID**: PHASE1-054

## Description

Configure CI job for automated testing in GitHub Actions. This task converts the testing workflow from jarek-va (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) to a Node.js/TypeScript equivalent for telegram-receiver.

The workflow should run on push and pull requests to main/master branches, and support manual triggering. It should include code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking) and comprehensive test execution (unit, integration) with coverage reporting.

**Reference Implementation**: `jarek-va/.github/workflows/test.yml`

## Checklist

### Workflow Setup

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` file
- [ ] Configure workflow triggers (push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch)
- [ ] Set up job to run on ubuntu-latest

### Environment Setup

- [ ] Add step to checkout code (with full history for diff comparison)
- [ ] Add step to set up Node.js (version >=18.0.0 as per package.json engines)
- [ ] Add step to install dependencies (`npm ci` for reproducible builds)
- [ ] Configure caching for node_modules (optional optimization)

### Code Quality Checks

- [ ] Add step to run ESLint with changed file detection (lint only changed source files when files changed, exclude test files)
- [ ] If changed files detected: run ESLint on changed source files only (filter out tests/\*_/_.ts)
- [ ] If no changed files: run ESLint on all files (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Add step to check code formatting (`npm run format:check`)
- [ ] Add step to run TypeScript type checking (`npm run type-check`)

### Changed File Detection (Core Feature)

- [ ] Add step to detect changed TypeScript/JavaScript files (.ts, .js) for PRs and pushes
- [ ] For PRs: compare against base branch (`github.event.pull_request.base.sha`)
- [ ] For pushes: compare against previous commit (`HEAD~1`)
- [ ] Filter changed files to source files (src/**/\*.ts) and test files (tests/**/\*.ts)
- [ ] Output changed files for use in subsequent steps

### Testing

- [ ] Add step to run tests with changed file detection (run only affected tests when files changed)
- [ ] Map changed source files to related test files:
  - `src/services/telegramService.ts` → `tests/unit/services/telegramService.test.ts` or `tests/integration/services/telegramService.test.ts`
  - `src/controllers/telegramController.ts` → `tests/unit/controllers/telegramController.test.ts` or `tests/integration/controllers/telegramController.test.ts`
- [ ] If changed files detected: run tests for changed test files + tests related to changed source files
- [ ] If no changed files: run all tests (`npm run test`)
- [ ] Add step to run unit tests (`npm run test:unit` or via Jest test patterns)
- [ ] Add step to run integration tests (`npm run test:integration` or via Jest test patterns)
- [ ] Configure test environment variables (NODE_ENV=test, REDIS_URL if needed for integration tests)
- [ ] Add step to generate coverage report (`npm run test:coverage`)
- [ ] Consider adding Redis service container if integration tests require real Redis connection

### Coverage Reporting

- [ ] Configure coverage report generation (already configured in jest.config.ts)
- [ ] Add step to upload coverage report (optional: to codecov, coveralls, or GitHub Actions artifacts)
- [ ] Ensure coverage reports are generated in formats: text, lcov, html (as per jest.config.ts)

### Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Add test result summary/annotation in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Configure test timeout handling (Jest default is 5000ms, can be increased if needed)
- [ ] Add step to fail workflow if coverage drops below threshold (optional)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 11. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

### Implementation Guidance

**Rails Reference**: The jarek-va application has a comprehensive test workflow at `.github/workflows/test.yml` that includes:

- **Changed file detection** (core feature, not optional) - detects changed `.rb` and `.rake` files
- **Smart linting** - RuboCop runs only on changed source files (excludes spec files)
- **Smart test execution** - RSpec runs only tests related to changed files:
  - Changed spec files are run directly
  - Changed source files trigger their corresponding spec files (e.g., `app/services/telegram_service.rb` → `spec/services/telegram_service_spec.rb`)
- Database setup for tests

**Node.js/TypeScript Adaptation**:

- Use `actions/setup-node@v4` for Node.js setup
- Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for reproducible builds in CI
- Jest is already configured in `jest.config.ts` with coverage reporting
- ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript are configured in `package.json`
- Test scripts are available: `test:unit`, `test:integration`, `test:coverage`
- Coverage is configured to generate text, lcov, and html reports
- **Changed file detection** must be adapted for TypeScript/JavaScript:
  - Detect `.ts` and `.js` files instead of `.rb` and `.rake`
  - Map source files to test files: `src/**/*.ts` → `tests/unit/**/*.test.ts` or `tests/integration/**/*.test.ts`
  - Test file naming: `telegramService.ts` → `telegramService.test.ts` (not `telegram_service_spec.rb`)
- **Smart linting**: Run ESLint only on changed source files (exclude `tests/**/*.ts`), similar to Rails RuboCop pattern

**Key Differences from Rails**:

- No database setup needed (telegram-receiver uses Redis, which can be mocked or use a service container)
- TypeScript type checking is additional step not present in Rails
- Prettier formatting check is additional step
- Jest handles both unit and integration tests (no separate test framework)
- File extensions: `.ts`, `.js` instead of `.rb`, `.rake`
- Test file patterns: `tests/unit/**/*.test.ts` and `tests/integration/**/*.test.ts` instead of `spec/**/*_spec.rb`
- Source file patterns: `src/**/*.ts` instead of `app/**/*.rb`
- Test file naming: `telegramService.test.ts` instead of `telegram_service_spec.rb`

**Workflow Structure**:

1. Checkout code (with full history for diff comparison)
2. Setup Node.js
3. Install dependencies
4. **Detect changed files** (TypeScript/JavaScript files)
5. Run linting (ESLint) - only on changed source files if changes detected
6. Check formatting (Prettier)
7. Type check (TypeScript)
8. Run tests with coverage - only affected tests if changes detected
9. Upload coverage (optional)

**Changed File Detection Logic** (adapted from Rails):

- For PRs: `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR $BASE_SHA..$HEAD_SHA | grep -E '\.(ts|js)$'`
- For pushes: `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR HEAD~1..HEAD | grep -E '\.(ts|js)$'`
- Filter source files: `grep -E '^src/.*\.(ts|js)$'`
- Filter test files: `grep -E '^tests/.*\.(ts|js)$'`
- Map source to tests: `src/services/telegramService.ts` → `tests/unit/services/telegramService.test.ts` or `tests/integration/services/telegramService.test.ts`

**Coverage Upload Options**:

- Use `codecov/codecov-action@v3` for Codecov integration
- Use `actions/upload-artifact` to store coverage reports as artifacts
- Or use `coverallsapp/github-action` for Coveralls integration

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
