# PHASE1-056: Test CI workflow locally (optional)

**Section**: 11. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
**Subsection**: 11.7
**Task ID**: PHASE1-056

## Description

Test the CI workflow locally using the `act` tool to verify that the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) works correctly before pushing changes. This optional task allows developers to catch workflow issues early and iterate faster without waiting for GitHub Actions to run. The `act` tool runs GitHub Actions workflows locally using Docker, simulating the GitHub Actions environment.

**Prerequisites**: This task requires:

- The CI workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) must exist (created in PHASE1-051)
- Docker must be installed and running (required by `act`)
- Node.js environment must be available locally

**Reference Implementation**: While the Rails application (`jarek-va`) doesn't have specific documentation for local workflow testing, this task adds a valuable development workflow improvement for faster iteration.

## Checklist

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Verify that `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists (created in PHASE1-051)
- [ ] Verify Docker is installed and running (`docker --version` and `docker ps`)
- [ ] Verify Node.js is installed locally (`node --version`)

### Install act Tool

- [ ] Install `act` tool for local GitHub Actions testing
  - **macOS**: `brew install act` or download from GitHub releases
  - **Linux**: Download from GitHub releases or use package manager
  - **Windows**: Download from GitHub releases or use WSL
- [ ] Verify installation: `act --version`

### Test Workflow Locally

- [ ] List available workflows: `act -l` (should show the CI workflow)
- [ ] Run workflow with `push` event simulation: `act push`
- [ ] Run workflow with `pull_request` event simulation: `act pull_request`
- [ ] Run workflow with `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger): `act workflow_dispatch`
- [ ] Verify all workflow steps execute successfully:
  - Checkout code
  - Set up Node.js
  - Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
  - Detect changed files
  - Run linting (ESLint)
  - Run formatting check (Prettier)
  - Run type checking (TypeScript)
  - Build project (`npm run build`)
  - Run tests (Jest)

### Verify Workflow Output

- [ ] Verify workflow completes without errors
- [ ] Verify all steps show expected output
- [ ] Verify build artifacts are created (`dist/` directory)
- [ ] Verify tests run and pass
- [ ] Verify linting and type checking pass

### Fix Issues (if any)

- [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] Fix workflow file issues (update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` if needed)
- [ ] Fix environment/Docker issues (if any)
- [ ] Re-run workflow to verify fixes
- [ ] Update workflow file if changes are needed

## Implementation Details

### Workflow File Location

- **CI Workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (created in PHASE1-051)
- The workflow should be named "CI" or "Run Automated Tests"

### act Tool Usage

#### Basic Commands

- List workflows: `act -l`
- Run push event: `act push`
- Run pull request event: `act pull_request`
- Run specific workflow: `act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml push`
- Run specific job: `act -j test push`
- Dry run (list steps): `act -n push`

#### Common Options

- `-v` or `--verbose`: Verbose output
- `-W` or `--workflows`: Specify workflow file path
- `-j` or `--job`: Run specific job
- `-e` or `--eventpath`: Path to event JSON file
- `--secret`: Pass secrets (e.g., `--secret GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token`)
- `--env`: Pass environment variables

#### Event Simulation

- **Push event**: `act push` (simulates push to main branch)
- **Pull request**: `act pull_request` (simulates PR event)
- **Manual trigger**: `act workflow_dispatch`

### Expected Workflow Steps

When running `act push`, the workflow should execute these steps in order:

1. Checkout code
2. Set up Node.js (version >=18.0.0)
3. Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
4. Detect changed files
5. Run ESLint linter
6. Run Prettier format check
7. Run TypeScript type checking
8. Build TypeScript project (`npm run build`)
9. Verify build artifacts (`dist/` directory is created with compiled JavaScript files)
10. Run Jest tests

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Docker Not Running

- **Issue**: `act` fails with Docker connection error
- **Solution**: Start Docker daemon (`sudo systemctl start docker` on Linux, or start Docker Desktop)

#### Missing Secrets

- **Issue**: Workflow fails due to missing secrets
- **Solution**: Use `--secret` flag: `act push --secret GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token`

#### Large Docker Images

- **Issue**: First run is slow due to downloading Docker images
- **Solution**: This is normal; subsequent runs will be faster

#### Workflow File Not Found

- **Issue**: `act -l` shows no workflows
- **Solution**: Verify `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists and is valid YAML

#### Node.js Version Mismatch

- **Issue**: Workflow uses different Node.js version than local
- **Solution**: `act` uses Docker images, so version should match workflow configuration

### Verification Checklist

After running `act push`, verify:

- [ ] All steps execute without errors
- [ ] Dependencies install successfully (`npm ci` completes)
- [ ] Linting passes (ESLint)
- [ ] Formatting check passes (Prettier)
- [ ] Type checking passes (TypeScript)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`dist/` directory created)
- [ ] Tests run and pass (Jest)
- [ ] Workflow completes with success status

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 11. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- This is an **optional** task but highly recommended for faster development iteration
- Testing locally with `act` helps catch workflow issues before pushing to GitHub
- `act` requires Docker to run, as it uses Docker containers to simulate GitHub Actions runners
- The workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) must exist before this task can be completed (created in PHASE1-051)
- This task validates that the CI workflow works correctly locally before relying on GitHub Actions
- If workflow issues are found, update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and re-test

- Next: PHASE1-057

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
