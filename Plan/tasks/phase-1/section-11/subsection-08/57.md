# PHASE1-057: Create CD workflow file (basic)

**Section**: 11. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
**Subsection**: 11.8
**Task ID**: PHASE1-057

## Description

Create a basic CD (Continuous Deployment) workflow file for GitHub Actions. This workflow should handle building and deploying the Node.js/TypeScript application.

**Reference**: The jarek-va Rails application has a deployment workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that uses SSH deployment and Docker Compose. This task creates a basic version that can be extended later with actual deployment logic.

**Context**: This is a foundational CD workflow for Phase 1. The deployment step will be a placeholder for now, as the full deployment strategy (SSH, Docker registry, etc.) will be configured in later phases.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/cd.yml` file
- [ ] Set workflow name to "CD"
- [ ] Configure trigger on push to main branch (or tags)
- [ ] Add `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual deployments
- [ ] Define `deploy` job running on `ubuntu-latest`
- [ ] Add step to checkout code using `actions/checkout@v4`
- [ ] Add step to setup Node.js (use version >=18.0.0 as specified in package.json engines)
- [ ] Add step to install dependencies using `npm ci` (for reproducible builds)
- [ ] Add step to build project using `npm run build` (runs TypeScript compiler)
- [ ] Add step to build Docker image (use docker build command)
- [ ] Add step to push Docker image (conditional, only if registry is configured via secrets)
- [ ] Add step to deploy (placeholder comment/echo statement for now)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 11. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Reference Implementation**: See `jarek-va/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for the Rails deployment workflow (uses SSH deployment and Docker Compose)
- **Build Command**: Use `npm run build` which runs `tsc` to compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- **Node.js Version**: Use Node.js 18.x or higher (as specified in package.json engines field)
- **Docker**: The workflow should build a Docker image, but actual deployment will be added in later phases
- **Manual Trigger**: Include `workflow_dispatch` to allow manual workflow execution from GitHub UI

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
