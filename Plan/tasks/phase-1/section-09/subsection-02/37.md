# PHASE1-037: Create .dockerignore file

**Section**: 9. Docker Configuration
**Subsection**: 9.2
**Task ID**: PHASE1-037

## Description

Create `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from Docker build context. This improves build performance and reduces image size by preventing copying of development files, dependencies, test files, and other non-runtime artifacts into the Docker image.

- [ ] Add Git files to ignore list:
  - [ ] `.git/`
  - [ ] `.gitignore`

  - [ ] `README.md`

  - [ ] `.env`
  - [ ] `.env.local`
  - [ ] `.env.*.local`
  - [ ] `.env*` (all environment files)
- [ ] Add dependencies to ignore list:
  - [ ] `node_modules/` (will be installed in container)
- [ ] Add build artifacts to ignore list:
  - [ ] `dist/` (will be built in container)
- [ ] Add test files to ignore list:
  - [ ] `tests/`
  - [ ] `coverage/`
  - [ ] `test-results/` (Playwright test results)
  - [ ] `playwright-report/` (Playwright HTML reports)
  - [ ] `playwright/.cache/` (Playwright cache)
  - [ ] `.nyc_output/` (test coverage tool output)
- [ ] Add log and temporary files to ignore list:
  - [ ] `log/*`
  - [ ] `tmp/*`
  - [ ] `*.log`
- [ ] Add TypeScript build artifacts to ignore list:
  - [ ] `*.tsbuildinfo` (TypeScript incremental build info)
- [ ] Add IDE files to ignore list:
  - [ ] `.vscode/`
  - [ ] `.idea/`
  - [ ] `*.swp`
  - [ ] `*.swo`
  - [ ] `*~`

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
