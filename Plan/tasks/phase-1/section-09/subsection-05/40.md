# PHASE1-040: Test Docker build

**Section**: 9. Docker Configuration
**Subsection**: 9.5
**Task ID**: PHASE1-040

## Description

Test the Docker build process for the telegram-receiver Node.js/TypeScript application. This task verifies that the Dockerfile created in PHASE1-036 builds successfully, produces a working container image, and that the containerized application starts correctly and responds to health checks. This ensures the Docker configuration is correct before proceeding with docker-compose testing in PHASE1-041.

**Note**: The curl commands in this task are for Docker deployment verification only. For development testing, use automated tests (`npm test`, `npm run test:integration`) instead of running the server manually.

## Prerequisites

- PHASE1-036 (Create Dockerfile) must be completed
- Dockerfile must exist in the project root
- `.dockerignore` file should exist (from PHASE1-037)

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify Dockerfile exists in project root
- [ ] Verify `.dockerignore` file exists (from PHASE1-037)
- [ ] Run `docker build -t telegram-receiver .` (or `telegram-receiver:latest`)
- [ ] Verify build completes without errors or warnings
- [ ] Verify image was created: `docker images telegram-receiver`
- [ ] Run container: `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name telegram-receiver-test telegram-receiver`
- [ ] Wait a few seconds for container to start
- [ ] Check container logs: `docker logs telegram-receiver-test` (verify no errors)
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set correctly: `docker exec telegram-receiver-test env | grep -E "(NODE_ENV|PORT)"` (should show NODE_ENV=production and PORT=3000)
- [ ] Verify shared_db directory exists: `docker exec telegram-receiver-test ls -la /app/shared_db` (directory should exist with proper permissions)
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3000/health` (should return 200 OK)
- [ ] Verify health endpoint response contains expected JSON structure:
  - [ ] `status: "healthy"` (must match Rails implementation)
  - [ ] `service: "..."` (service name)
  - [ ] `version: "..."` (version number)
- [ ] Verify container HEALTHCHECK is configured: `docker inspect telegram-receiver-test | grep -A 5 Healthcheck` (should show HEALTHCHECK directive from Dockerfile)
- [ ] Check container status: `docker ps` (container should be running)
- [ ] Verify container health status: `docker inspect telegram-receiver-test --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'` (should show "healthy" after healthcheck runs)
- [ ] Stop container: `docker stop telegram-receiver-test`
- [ ] Remove container: `docker rm telegram-receiver-test`
- [ ] (Optional) Remove test image: `docker rmi telegram-receiver` (if not needed for next task)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 9. Docker Configuration
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Prerequisites**: This task requires PHASE1-036 (Create Dockerfile) to be completed first
- The Docker image tag should be `telegram-receiver` (not `jarek-va`) to match the project name
- The health endpoint should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/health` when the container is running
- The health endpoint response should match the Rails implementation structure:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "healthy",
    "service": "telegram-receiver",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
  ```
- Use `docker run -d` (detached mode) to run the container in the background
- Use `--name` flag to give the container a specific name for easier management
- Container should expose port 3000 (matching the PORT environment variable)
- Environment variables should be set: `NODE_ENV=production` and `PORT=3000` (default)
- The shared database directory `/app/shared_db` should be created (required for shared SQLite database access)
- The Dockerfile should include a HEALTHCHECK directive (as specified in PHASE1-036) that checks `/health` endpoint
- After testing, clean up containers and optionally images to avoid cluttering Docker
- If the build fails, check:
  - Dockerfile syntax is correct
  - All required files are present (package.json, tsconfig.json, src/, etc.)
  - `.dockerignore` is not excluding necessary files
  - Node.js version matches the engines requirement in package.json (node >=18.0.0)
- If the container fails to start, check:
  - Application code compiles successfully (`npm run build` works)
  - Entrypoint script (if exists) executes correctly
  - Required directories are created with proper permissions
  - Port 3000 is not already in use on the host

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
