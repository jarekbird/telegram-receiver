# PHASE1-036: Create Dockerfile

**Section**: 9. Docker Configuration
**Subsection**: 9.1
**Task ID**: PHASE1-036

## Description

Create a production-ready Dockerfile for the Node.js/TypeScript telegram-receiver application. The Dockerfile should follow best practices for Node.js applications, including proper layer caching, production optimizations, and health checks. Reference the jarek-va Dockerfile (`/cursor/repositories/jarek-va/Dockerfile`) for patterns, but adapt for Node.js/TypeScript instead of Ruby/Rails.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `Dockerfile` in project root
- [ ] Use Node.js base image matching package.json engines requirement (`node:18-alpine` or `node:18-slim`)
- [ ] Install any required system dependencies (e.g., curl for health checks, sqlite3 if needed for shared database)
- [ ] Set WORKDIR to `/app`
- [ ] Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first (for better layer caching)
- [ ] **If using single-stage build**: Install all dependencies (`npm ci`), build TypeScript (`npm run build`), then prune dev dependencies (`npm prune --production`)
- [ ] **If using multi-stage build (recommended)**:
  - Build stage: Install all dependencies (`npm ci`), copy source files, run `npm run build`
  - Production stage: Install only production dependencies (`npm ci --only=production`), copy built files from build stage
- [ ] Copy source files (`src/`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.) - only needed in build stage if using multi-stage
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript to JavaScript (in build stage if using multi-stage)
- [ ] Create `/app/shared_db` directory with proper permissions (required for shared SQLite database at `/app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3`)
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV environment variable to `production`
- [ ] Set PORT environment variable (default to 3000, can be overridden)
- [ ] Use EXPOSE directive to document the port (default 3000)
- [ ] Add HEALTHCHECK directive (check `/health` endpoint using curl: `curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1`)
- [ ] Set CMD to start production server (`npm start` or `node dist/index.js`)
  - [ ] **Note**: This CMD is for production deployment only. Developers should NOT run the server manually for testing - use automated tests instead.
- [ ] Consider creating `docker-entrypoint.sh` script for initialization (create shared_db directory, set permissions) - reference jarek-va pattern
- [ ] Create `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (node_modules, tests, coverage, .git, etc.)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 9. Docker Configuration
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Reference the jarek-va Dockerfile (`/cursor/repositories/jarek-va/Dockerfile`) and `docker-entrypoint.sh` for patterns:
  - Health check implementation (HEALTHCHECK with curl to `/health` endpoint)
  - Environment variable configuration (NODE_ENV=production, PORT=3000)
  - Shared database directory setup: **MUST create `/app/shared_db` directory** (the application uses shared SQLite database at `/app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3` as referenced throughout task files)
  - Entrypoint script pattern: jarek-va uses `docker-entrypoint.sh` to ensure `/app/shared_db` exists and has proper permissions (`mkdir -p /app/shared_db` and `chmod 777 /app/shared_db`)
- **Important**: TypeScript compilation requires dev dependencies (TypeScript compiler, ts-node, etc.), so:
  - **Single-stage approach**: Install all deps → build → prune dev deps (larger final image)
  - **Multi-stage approach (recommended)**: Build stage with all deps + source, production stage with only runtime deps + built files (smaller final image)
- The application uses TypeScript, so the build step is required to compile to JavaScript
- The main entry point is `dist/index.js` (as specified in package.json `main` field)
- Default port is 3000 (from `.env.example`), but should be configurable via PORT environment variable
- Health check endpoint: `/health` (implemented in PHASE1-013, PHASE1-014, PHASE1-015)
- **Shared Database**: The application accesses shared SQLite database at `/app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3` (referenced in all task files). The Dockerfile must ensure this directory exists and is writable, similar to jarek-va's docker-entrypoint.sh pattern
- **.dockerignore should exclude**: `node_modules`, `dist` (will be built in container), `tests`, `coverage`, `.git`, `.env`, `*.log`, `Plan/`, `docs/`, `playwright-report/`, etc.

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
