# PHASE1-017: Create JSON body parser middleware

**Section**: 6. Request/Response Middleware
**Subsection**: 6.1
**Task ID**: PHASE1-017

## Description

Create JSON body parser middleware to enable Express to parse JSON request bodies. In Rails, `ActionController::API` automatically parses JSON when `Content-Type: application/json` is set, making request data available in `params`. Express requires explicit middleware (`express.json()`) to populate `req.body` with parsed JSON data.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` - Rails uses `ActionController::API` which automatically parses JSON request bodies when `Content-Type: application/json` is set. Express requires explicit middleware to achieve the same functionality.

## Checklist

- [ ] Open `src/app.ts`
- [ ] Import Express (if not already imported): `import express from 'express'`
- [ ] Use `express.json()` middleware (it's a method, not a separate import)
- [ ] Apply middleware using `app.use(express.json())`
- [ ] Verify middleware is applied before routes (middleware order matters in Express - JSON parser should be early in the stack)

## Validation Report

### Task Review: PHASE1-017

#### Task Information

- **Task ID**: PHASE1-017
- **Task Title**: Create JSON body parser middleware
- **Rails File**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` (ActionController::API automatically handles JSON parsing)

#### Validation Results

##### ✓ Correct

- Task correctly identifies the need for JSON body parser middleware in Express
- File path structure (`src/app.ts`) is appropriate and matches previous tasks (PHASE1-010, PHASE1-015)
- Task scope is appropriate - focused on adding JSON parsing middleware only
- Checklist correctly specifies using `express.json()` middleware
- Checklist correctly emphasizes middleware ordering (before routes)
- Task follows logical sequence (after route registration in PHASE1-015, before other middleware tasks)

##### ⚠️ Issues Found

1. **Missing Rails Reference**
   - **Issue**: Task doesn't reference how Rails handles JSON parsing for context
   - **Location**: Missing from description
   - **Impact**: Less context for developers to understand why this middleware is needed
   - **Fix Required**: Add Rails reference noting that `ActionController::API` automatically parses JSON, but Express requires explicit middleware

2. **Incomplete Description**
   - **Issue**: Description is very brief ("Create JSON body parser middleware")
   - **Location**: Description section
   - **Impact**: Doesn't provide enough context about what this middleware does and why it's needed
   - **Fix Required**: Expand description to mention that this middleware enables Express to parse JSON request bodies, which Rails does automatically via ActionController::API

3. **Missing Configuration Options**
   - **Issue**: Task doesn't mention any configuration options for `express.json()` middleware (e.g., `limit`, `strict`, `type`)
   - **Location**: Checklist item 2
   - **Impact**: May miss important configuration that Rails has by default (e.g., body size limits)
   - **Fix Required**: Add note about default configuration being sufficient for now, or mention that configuration can be added later if needed

4. **Unclear Middleware Ordering**
   - **Issue**: Task says "Verify middleware is applied before routes" but doesn't specify exact placement relative to other middleware
   - **Location**: Checklist item 4
   - **Impact**: Developer may not know where exactly to place it in the middleware stack
   - **Fix Required**: Clarify that JSON parser should be applied early in the middleware stack, before route handlers but after basic Express setup

5. **Missing Import Statement Example**
   - **Issue**: Task says "Import `express.json()` middleware" but doesn't show the exact import syntax
   - **Location**: Checklist item 2
   - **Impact**: Unclear whether to import from 'express' or use express.json() directly
   - **Fix Required**: Clarify that `express.json()` is a method, not a separate import: `import express from 'express';` then use `express.json()`

6. **Missing Context About Rails Behavior**
   - **Issue**: Task doesn't explain that Rails controllers automatically receive parsed JSON in `params`, but Express requires this middleware to populate `req.body`
   - **Location**: Missing from description/notes
   - **Impact**: Developers may not understand the conversion context
   - **Fix Required**: Add note explaining the Rails vs Express difference

##### 📝 Recommendations

1. **Add Rails Reference**: Add to description:
   - **Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` - Rails uses `ActionController::API` which automatically parses JSON request bodies when `Content-Type: application/json` is set. Express requires explicit middleware to achieve the same functionality.

2. **Expand Description**: Update to:
   - "Create JSON body parser middleware to enable Express to parse JSON request bodies. In Rails, `ActionController::API` automatically parses JSON when `Content-Type: application/json` is set, making request data available in `params`. Express requires explicit middleware (`express.json()`) to populate `req.body` with parsed JSON data."

3. **Clarify Import Syntax**: Update checklist item 2 to:
   - "Import Express (if not already imported): `import express from 'express'`"
   - "Use `express.json()` middleware (it's a method, not a separate import)"

4. **Add Configuration Note**: Add to Notes section:
   - "The `express.json()` middleware uses default configuration. If body size limits or other options are needed later, they can be configured by passing options: `express.json({ limit: '10mb' })`"

5. **Clarify Middleware Ordering**: Update checklist item 4 to:
   - "Verify middleware is applied before routes (middleware order matters in Express - JSON parser should be early in the stack)"

6. **Add Context Note**: Add to Notes section:
   - "**Rails Comparison**: Rails controllers automatically receive parsed JSON in `params` hash. Express requires this middleware to parse JSON and populate `req.body`. Without this middleware, `req.body` will be `undefined` for JSON requests."

#### Detailed Comparison

##### JSON Parsing in Rails

**Rails Implementation** (`application_controller.rb:3`, `telegram_controller.rb:14-15`):

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
  # Rails automatically parses JSON when Content-Type is application/json
  # Request data is available in params hash
end

# In controllers:
def webhook
  # Telegram sends updates as JSON in the request body
  # Rails automatically parses JSON when Content-Type is application/json
  update = request.content_type&.include?('application/json') ? request.parameters : params
  # params already contains parsed JSON data
end
```

**Rails Behavior**:

- `ActionController::API` automatically parses JSON request bodies
- Parsed data is available in `params` hash
- No explicit middleware configuration needed
- Works when `Content-Type: application/json` header is present

##### JSON Parsing in Express

**Expected Express Implementation** (this task):

```typescript
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

// JSON body parser middleware - must be applied before routes
app.use(express.json());

// Now routes can access parsed JSON in req.body
app.post('/telegram/webhook', (req, res) => {
  // req.body contains parsed JSON data
  const update = req.body;
});
```

**Express Behavior**:

- Requires explicit `express.json()` middleware
- Parsed data is available in `req.body` (not `req.params`)
- Must be applied before route handlers
- Works when `Content-Type: application/json` header is present

**Comparison**:

- ✓ Task correctly identifies need for explicit middleware in Express
- ✓ Task correctly specifies using `express.json()`
- ⚠️ Task could better explain the Rails vs Express difference
- ⚠️ Task could mention configuration options if needed

##### Middleware Ordering

**Express Middleware Stack** (typical order):

1. Basic Express setup (app creation)
2. **JSON parser** ← This task (should be early)
3. URL-encoded parser (PHASE1-018)
4. CORS (PHASE1-019)
5. Routes (PHASE1-015)
6. Error handlers (later tasks)

**Task Coverage**: Task correctly emphasizes ordering but could be more specific about placement relative to other middleware

##### Dependencies

- **Express**: Required (installed in PHASE1-009)
- **App Instance**: `src/app.ts` created in PHASE1-010, routes registered in PHASE1-015
- **Task Coverage**: Task correctly depends on app.ts existing

##### Related Components

- **App File**: `src/app.ts` (created in PHASE1-010, routes added in PHASE1-015)
- **Next Middleware**: PHASE1-018 (URL-encoded parser) should come after JSON parser
- **Controllers**: Will use `req.body` to access parsed JSON (similar to Rails `params`)
- **Task Coverage**: Task correctly focuses only on JSON parser middleware

##### Rails Controllers Using JSON

**Examples from Rails**:

- `TelegramController#webhook` - receives JSON webhook updates
- `CursorRunnerController#execute` - receives JSON with repository, prompt, etc.
- `CursorRunnerController#iterate` - receives JSON with iteration parameters
- `AgentToolsController#create` - receives JSON with tool parameters

**All these controllers rely on automatic JSON parsing**, which Express needs this middleware to replicate.

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 6. Request/Response Middleware
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` - Rails uses `ActionController::API` which automatically parses JSON request bodies when `Content-Type: application/json` is set. Express requires explicit `express.json()` middleware to achieve the same functionality.
- **Middleware Ordering**: The JSON parser middleware must be applied before route handlers. Typical Express middleware order: JSON parser → URL-encoded parser → CORS → Routes → Error handlers.
- **Import Syntax**: `express.json()` is a method, not a separate import. Import Express with `import express from 'express'`, then use `express.json()`.
- **Configuration**: Default configuration is sufficient for now. If body size limits or other options are needed later, configure with: `express.json({ limit: '10mb' })`.
- **Rails Comparison**: Rails controllers automatically receive parsed JSON in `params` hash. Express requires this middleware to parse JSON and populate `req.body`. Without this middleware, `req.body` will be `undefined` for JSON requests.

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
