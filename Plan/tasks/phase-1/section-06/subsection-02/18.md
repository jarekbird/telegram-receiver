# PHASE1-018: Create URL encoded parser middleware

**Section**: 6. Request/Response Middleware
**Subsection**: 6.2
**Task ID**: PHASE1-018

## Description

Create URL encoded parser middleware to enable Express to parse URL-encoded form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded). In Rails, `ActionController::API` automatically parses URL-encoded form data, making request data available in `params`. Express requires explicit middleware (`express.urlencoded()`) to populate `req.body` with parsed form data.

**Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` - Rails uses `ActionController::API` which automatically parses URL-encoded form data when `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is set. Express requires explicit middleware to achieve the same functionality.

## Checklist

- [ ] Open `src/app.ts`
- [ ] Import Express (if not already imported): `import express from 'express'`
- [ ] Use `express.urlencoded()` middleware (it's a method, not a separate import)
- [ ] Configure with `{ extended: true }` option
- [ ] Apply middleware using `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))`
- [ ] Verify middleware is applied after JSON parser (PHASE1-017) but before routes (middleware order matters in Express)

#### Detailed Comparison

##### URL-Encoded Parsing in Rails

**Rails Implementation** (`application_controller.rb:3`, `telegram_controller.rb:54-55`, `cursor_runner_controller.rb:12-15`):

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
  # Rails automatically parses URL-encoded form data when Content-Type is application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  # Request data is available in params hash
end

# In controllers:
def set_webhook
  webhook_url = params[:url] || default_webhook_url
  secret_token = params[:secret_token] || Rails.application.config.telegram_webhook_secret
  # params automatically contains parsed URL-encoded form data
end

def execute
  repository: params[:repository],
  branch_name: params[:branch_name] || params[:branchName],
  prompt: params[:prompt],
  # params can contain both JSON and URL-encoded form data
end
```

**Rails Behavior**:

- `ActionController::API` automatically parses URL-encoded form data
- Parsed data is available in `params` hash
- Supports nested parameters (e.g., `user[name]=John` becomes `params[:user][:name]`)
- No explicit middleware configuration needed
- Works when `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header is present
- Also handles query string parameters automatically

##### URL-Encoded Parsing in Express

**Expected Express Implementation** (this task):

```typescript
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

// JSON body parser middleware (from PHASE1-017)
app.use(express.json());

// URL-encoded body parser middleware - must be applied after JSON parser but before routes
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Now routes can access parsed URL-encoded form data in req.body
app.post('/telegram/set_webhook', (req, res) => {
  // req.body contains parsed URL-encoded form data
  const webhook_url = req.body.url || default_webhook_url;
  const secret_token = req.body.secret_token || config.telegram_webhook_secret;
});
```

**Express Behavior**:

- Requires explicit `express.urlencoded()` middleware
- Parsed data is available in `req.body` (not `req.params`)
- `extended: true` supports nested objects (matches Rails behavior)
- Must be applied before route handlers
- Works when `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header is present
- Query string parameters are handled separately via `req.query` (not this middleware)

**Comparison**:

- ✓ Task correctly identifies need for explicit middleware in Express
- ✓ Task correctly specifies using `express.urlencoded()` with `extended: true`
- ⚠️ Task could better explain the Rails vs Express difference
- ⚠️ Task could explain why `extended: true` is needed (matches Rails nested params)
- ⚠️ Task could mention configuration options if needed

##### Middleware Ordering

**Express Middleware Stack** (typical order):

1. Basic Express setup (app creation)
2. JSON parser (PHASE1-017) ← Should be first body parser
3. **URL-encoded parser** ← This task (should come after JSON parser)
4. CORS (PHASE1-019)
5. Routes (PHASE1-015)
6. Error handlers (later tasks)

**Task Coverage**: Task correctly emphasizes ordering but could be more specific about placement relative to JSON parser

##### Dependencies

- **Express**: Required (installed in PHASE1-009)
- **App Instance**: `src/app.ts` created in PHASE1-010, routes registered in PHASE1-015
- **JSON Parser**: Should be applied after JSON parser middleware (PHASE1-017)
- **Task Coverage**: Task correctly depends on app.ts existing

##### Related Components

- **App File**: `src/app.ts` (created in PHASE1-010, routes added in PHASE1-015, JSON parser added in PHASE1-017)
- **Previous Middleware**: PHASE1-017 (JSON parser) should come before URL-encoded parser
- **Next Middleware**: PHASE1-019 (CORS) should come after URL-encoded parser
- **Controllers**: Will use `req.body` to access parsed URL-encoded form data (similar to Rails `params`)
- **Task Coverage**: Task correctly focuses only on URL-encoded parser middleware

##### Rails Controllers Using URL-Encoded Form Data

**Examples from Rails**:

- `TelegramController#set_webhook` - receives URL-encoded form data with `url` and `secret_token` parameters
- `TelegramController#authenticate_admin` - reads `admin_secret` from params (can come from URL-encoded form or query string)
- `CursorRunnerController#execute` - receives parameters that could come from URL-encoded form data
- `AgentToolsController#create` - receives `tool`, `args`, and `conversation_id` parameters

**All these controllers rely on automatic URL-encoded parsing**, which Express needs this middleware to replicate.

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 6. Request/Response Middleware
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Rails Reference**: `jarek-va/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` - Rails uses `ActionController::API` which automatically parses URL-encoded form data when `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is set. Express requires explicit `express.urlencoded()` middleware to achieve the same functionality.
- **Middleware Ordering**: The URL-encoded parser middleware must be applied after JSON parser (PHASE1-017) but before route handlers. Typical Express middleware order: JSON parser → URL-encoded parser → CORS → Routes → Error handlers.
- **Import Syntax**: `express.urlencoded()` is a method, not a separate import. Import Express with `import express from 'express'`, then use `express.urlencoded()`.
- **Extended Option**: The `extended: true` option uses the `qs` library which supports nested objects (e.g., `user[name]=John&user[age]=30` becomes `{user: {name: 'John', age: 30}}`). This matches Rails behavior where nested parameters are supported. `extended: false` uses `querystring` which only supports flat objects.
- **Configuration**: Default configuration is sufficient for now. If body size limits or other options are needed later, configure with: `express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: '10mb', parameterLimit: 1000 })`
- **Rails Comparison**: Rails controllers automatically receive parsed URL-encoded form data in `params` hash. Express requires this middleware to parse URL-encoded data and populate `req.body`. Without this middleware, `req.body` will be `undefined` for URL-encoded form requests.

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
