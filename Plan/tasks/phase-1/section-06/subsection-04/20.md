# PHASE1-020: Create request logging middleware

**Section**: 6. Request/Response Middleware
**Subsection**: 6.4
**Task ID**: PHASE1-020

## Description

Create request logging middleware that logs incoming HTTP requests and their responses. This middleware should provide comprehensive request/response logging similar to Rails' built-in request logging with request_id tagging (see `jarek-va/config/environments/production.rb` line 43: `config.log_tags = [:request_id]`).

The middleware should log:

- Request method (GET, POST, etc.)
- Request URL/path
- Client IP address
- Request timestamp
- Unique request ID (for request tracing)
- Response status code
- Response time/duration

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/middleware/request-logger.middleware.ts` file
- [ ] Create Express middleware function with signature `(req, res, next) => void`
- [ ] Generate or extract unique request ID (use `req.id` if available from request-id middleware, or generate UUID)
- [ ] Store request start time using `Date.now()` or `process.hrtime()`
- [ ] Log incoming request with: method, URL, IP address, request ID, and timestamp
- [ ] Attach request ID to `req` object for use in other middleware/handlers
- [ ] Use `res.on('finish', ...)` to log response when request completes
- [ ] Log response with: status code, response time/duration, and request ID
- [ ] Use application logger (if available) or `console.log` with structured format (for now, use `console.log` since logger infrastructure may not exist yet)
- [ ] Handle errors appropriately and ensure `next()` is always called (wrap in try-catch if needed)
- [ ] Export middleware function
- [ ] Import and apply in `src/app.ts` (middleware order: JSON parser → URL-encoded parser → CORS → Request logger → Routes)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 6. Request/Response Middleware
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Rails Reference**: The jarek-va Rails application uses `config.log_tags = [:request_id]` in production (see `jarek-va/config/environments/production.rb` line 43), which prepends request_id to all log lines automatically. Rails generates a unique request ID for each request and tags all log entries with it. This Express middleware provides similar request tracing capability by logging request/response details with a unique request ID, enabling request correlation in logs. Note: Rails tags ALL log lines with request_id, while this middleware logs request/response events - both approaches enable request tracing.
- **Logging Format**: Consider logging in a structured format (JSON) for easier parsing and analysis. Example format: `{ "timestamp": "...", "requestId": "...", "method": "GET", "url": "/health", "ip": "127.0.0.1", "statusCode": 200, "duration": 15 }`
- **Request ID**: If a request-id middleware is already in place, use `req.id`. Otherwise, generate a UUID using `crypto.randomUUID()` (Node.js 14.17.0+) or the `uuid` package. Attach the request ID to `req.requestId` or `req.id` for use in other middleware/handlers.
- **Response Time**: Calculate duration as the difference between request start time and response finish time. Express `res.on('finish')` event fires when the response has been sent. Use `process.hrtime()` or `Date.now()` for timing (hrtime provides higher precision).
- **IP Address**: Extract client IP from `req.ip` (if Express trust proxy is configured via `app.set('trust proxy', true)`) or `req.connection.remoteAddress`. Consider `req.headers['x-forwarded-for']` for proxied requests (may contain comma-separated list of IPs).
- **Logger**: Since logger infrastructure may not exist yet (logger setup is in Phase 3), use `console.log` with structured JSON format for now. The middleware can be updated later to use a proper logger when available.
- **Middleware Ordering**: Request logger should be placed after CORS middleware (PHASE1-019) but before route handlers. This ensures all requests are logged, including those that fail CORS checks. Typical order: JSON parser → URL-encoded parser → CORS → **Request logger** → Routes → Error handlers.

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
