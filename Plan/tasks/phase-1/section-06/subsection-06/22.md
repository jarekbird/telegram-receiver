# PHASE1-022: Create 404 handler middleware

**Section**: 6. Request/Response Middleware
**Subsection**: 6.6
**Task ID**: PHASE1-022

## Description

Create 404 handler middleware that catches all requests that don't match any registered routes and returns a standardized 404 Not Found response matching the Rails error response format. In Rails, unmatched routes automatically return 404 responses. Express requires explicit middleware to handle unmatched routes and return consistent error responses.

The middleware should:

- Catch all requests that don't match any registered routes
- Return a standardized JSON error response matching the Rails format
- Set HTTP status code to 404 (Not Found)

**Rails Reference**: Rails automatically handles unmatched routes by returning a 404 response. Express requires explicit middleware registered after all routes to catch unmatched requests. This middleware should return the same error format as the error handler (PHASE1-021) for consistency.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/middleware/not-found.middleware.ts` file
- [ ] Import Express types: `import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express'`
- [ ] Create middleware function with 3 parameters `(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction)`
- [ ] Return JSON error response matching Rails format:
  ```json
  {
    "ok": false,
    "say": "Sorry, I couldn't find that resource.",
    "result": {
      "error": "Not Found"
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Set HTTP status code to 404 (Not Found)
- [ ] Handle case where response has already been sent (check `res.headersSent`)
- [ ] Export middleware function
- [ ] Import and apply in `src/app.ts` (after all routes, before error handler middleware)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 6. Request/Response Middleware
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Rails Reference**: Rails automatically handles unmatched routes by returning 404 responses. Express requires explicit middleware registered after all routes to catch unmatched requests. The jarek-va Rails application doesn't have explicit 404 handling in controllers - Rails handles this automatically via routing.
- **Middleware Ordering**: The 404 handler middleware must be registered after all route handlers but before the error handler middleware (PHASE1-021). Express processes middleware in order, so unmatched requests will fall through to this middleware only if no route matches.
- **Error Response Format**: Must match the Rails error format exactly to maintain API consistency:
  - `ok: false` - indicates request failure
  - `say: "Sorry, I couldn't find that resource."` - user-friendly message
  - `result: { error: "Not Found" }` - error details
- **Express Middleware**: Express middleware functions have 3 parameters `(req, res, next)`. This is different from error handlers which have 4 parameters `(err, req, res, next)`.
- **Response Already Sent**: Check `res.headersSent` before attempting to send a response to avoid "Cannot set headers after they are sent" errors
- **Route Matching**: This middleware will only be called if no route matches the request. Express processes routes in order, and if no route matches, the request falls through to this middleware.

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
