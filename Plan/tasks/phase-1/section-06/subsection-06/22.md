# PHASE1-022: Create 404 handler middleware

**Section**: 6. Request/Response Middleware
**Subsection**: 6.6
**Task ID**: PHASE1-022

## Description

Create 404 handler middleware that catches all requests that don't match any registered routes and returns a standardized 404 Not Found response matching the Rails error response format. In Rails, unmatched routes automatically return 404 responses. Express requires explicit middleware to handle unmatched routes and return consistent error responses.

The middleware should:

- Catch all requests that don't match any registered routes
- Return a standardized JSON error response matching the Rails format
- Set HTTP status code to 404 (Not Found)

**Rails Reference**: Rails automatically handles unmatched routes by returning a 404 response. Express requires explicit middleware registered after all routes to catch unmatched requests. This middleware should return the same error format as the error handler (PHASE1-021) for consistency.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/middleware/not-found.middleware.ts` file
- [ ] Import Express types: `import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express'`
- [ ] Create middleware function with 3 parameters `(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction)`
- [ ] Return JSON error response matching Rails format:
  ```json
  {
    "ok": false,
    "say": "Sorry, I couldn't find that resource.",
    "result": {
      "error": "Not Found"
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Set HTTP status code to 404 (Not Found)
- [ ] Handle case where response has already been sent (check `res.headersSent`)
- [ ] Export middleware function
- [ ] Import and apply in `src/app.ts` (after all routes, before error handler middleware)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 6. Request/Response Middleware
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- **Rails Reference**: Rails automatically handles unmatched routes by returning 404 responses. Express requires explicit middleware registered after all routes to catch unmatched requests. The jarek-va Rails application doesn't have explicit 404 handling in controllers - Rails handles this automatically via routing.
- **Middleware Ordering**: The 404 handler middleware must be registered after all route handlers but before the error handler middleware (PHASE1-021). Express processes middleware in order, so unmatched requests will fall through to this middleware only if no route matches.
- **Error Response Format**: Must match the Rails error format exactly to maintain API consistency:
  - `ok: false` - indicates request failure
  - `say: "Sorry, I couldn't find that resource."` - user-friendly message
  - `result: { error: "Not Found" }` - error details
- **Express Middleware**: Express middleware functions have 3 parameters `(req, res, next)`. This is different from error handlers which have 4 parameters `(err, req, res, next)`.
- **Response Already Sent**: Check `res.headersSent` before attempting to send a response to avoid "Cannot set headers after they are sent" errors
- **Route Matching**: This middleware will only be called if no route matches the request. Express processes routes in order, and if no route matches, the request falls through to this middleware.

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
