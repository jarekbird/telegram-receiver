# PHASE1-061: Document health endpoint

**Section**: 12. API Structure Documentation
**Subsection**: 12.4
**Task ID**: PHASE1-061

## Description

Document the health check endpoint based on the jarek-va Rails application implementation. The health endpoint provides basic service status information and is used for monitoring and service discovery. The endpoint returns the service status, name, and version information.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `docs/api/HEALTH.md` file
- [ ] Document GET `/health` endpoint
- [ ] Document that root endpoint `GET /` also serves the health check
- [ ] Document request format:
  - [ ] No request body required
  - [ ] No query parameters required
  - [ ] No authentication required
- [ ] Document response format:
  - [ ] HTTP status code: `200 OK`
  - [ ] Response body fields:
    - [ ] `status` (string): Always `"healthy"` when service is running
    - [ ] `service` (string): Service name from `APP_NAME` environment variable (default: `"Virtual Assistant API"`)
    - [ ] `version` (string): Service version from `APP_VERSION` environment variable (default: `"1.0.0"`)
- [ ] Document status codes:
  - [ ] `200 OK`: Service is healthy and responding
  - [ ] `500 Internal Server Error`: Service error (handled by ApplicationController error handler)
- [ ] Add example request/response:
  - [ ] Example request (curl)
  - [ ] Example successful response (JSON)
- [ ] Reference the Rails implementation:
  - [ ] Controller: `jarek-va/app/controllers/health_controller.rb`
  - [ ] Route: `jarek-va/config/routes.rb` (GET `/health` and root `/`)
  - [ ] Configuration: `jarek-va/config/application.rb` (app_name and app_version)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 12. API Structure Documentation
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- Reference the jarek-va Rails application (`/cursor/repositories/jarek-va`) for actual implementation:
  - Controller: `app/controllers/health_controller.rb` - Simple controller that returns health status JSON
  - Route: `config/routes.rb` - Defines both `GET /health` and root `GET /` routes pointing to `health#show`
  - Configuration: `config/application.rb` - Defines `app_name` and `app_version` config values from environment variables
- The health endpoint is a simple GET endpoint that requires no authentication and returns basic service information
- Response format follows the pattern: `{ status: 'healthy', service: '...', version: '...' }`
- The endpoint is used for service monitoring, health checks, and service discovery
- Both `/health` and `/` (root) endpoints serve the same health check response

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
