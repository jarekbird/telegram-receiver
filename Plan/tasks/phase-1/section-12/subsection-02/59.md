  - [ ] TypeScript configuration files (tsconfig.json, tsconfig.eslint.json)
  - [ ] Code quality configuration files (.eslintrc.json, .prettierrc.json)
  - [ ] Note about `node_modules/` directory (gitignored, contains dependencies)

- [ ] Document `tests/` directory structure and subdirectories:
  - [ ] `tests/unit/` - Unit tests organized by source structure
  - [ ] `tests/integration/` - Integration tests for API and services
  - [ ] `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end tests
  - [ ] `tests/fixtures/` - Test data and fixtures
  - [ ] `tests/helpers/` - Test utility functions
  - [ ] `tests/mocks/` - Mock implementations for external services
  - [ ] `tests/setup.ts` - Test configuration and setup
- [ ] Document root-level configuration files:
  - [ ] `jest.config.ts` - Jest test runner configuration
  - [ ] `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright E2E test configuration
  - [ ] `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration
  - [ ] `tsconfig.eslint.json` - TypeScript config for ESLint
  - [ ] `.eslintrc.json` - ESLint linting rules
  - [ ] `.prettierrc.json` - Prettier code formatting rules
- [ ] Document other important directories:
  - [ ] `Plan/` - Conversion plan and task documentation
  - [ ] `agents/` - Agent role definitions (Product Designer, Software Developer)
  - [ ] `coverage/` - Test coverage reports (generated by Jest)
  - [ ] `docs/` - Project documentation (architecture.md, manual-code-review.md, STRUCTURE.md)
- [ ] Explain purpose of each directory and its role in the application
- [ ] Include file naming conventions and organization patterns
- [ ] Document how the structure relates to the Rails-to-Node.js conversion

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 12. API Structure Documentation
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Related Tasks

- Next: PHASE1-060

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
