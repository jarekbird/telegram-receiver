# PHASE1-058: Create API documentation directory

**Section**: 12. API Structure Documentation
**Subsection**: 12.1
**Task ID**: PHASE1-058

## Description

Create the directory structure for API documentation. This includes:

- The `docs/api/` subdirectory for API endpoint-specific documentation

**Note**: The main `docs/` directory already exists (contains `architecture.md` and `manual-code-review.md`), so this task only needs to create the `docs/api/` subdirectory.

These directories will be used by subsequent tasks to organize API documentation files, including project structure documentation, API conventions, endpoint documentation, and API overview files.

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify `docs/` directory exists (already present with existing documentation files)
- [ ] Create `docs/api/` directory

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 1: Basic Node.js API Infrastructure
- Section: 12. API Structure Documentation
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
- The `docs/` directory already exists in the telegram-receiver project root and contains existing documentation files (`architecture.md`, `manual-code-review.md`)
- This task only needs to create the `docs/api/` subdirectory, which will be used by PHASE1-061 to create `docs/api/HEALTH.md`

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
