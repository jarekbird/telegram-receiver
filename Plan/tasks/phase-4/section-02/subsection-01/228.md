- Focus on identifying and fixing code quality issues
- Document all findings and improvements

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Evaluation Results

### Current State Assessment

**Date**: 2025-01-17

**Status**: Application is in early development stage with minimal business logic implemented.

### Findings

#### 1. Application Structure

- The `src/` directory is mostly empty (only empty `index.ts` file)
- No controllers, services, models, or routes have been implemented yet
- Application structure directories exist but contain only `.gitkeep` files

#### 2. Existing Code Review

**Test Utilities** (`tests/helpers/testUtils.ts`):

- ✅ **Complexity**: Low - Simple utility functions
- ✅ **Logic Correctness**: Correct implementation
- ✅ **Edge Cases**: `expectRejection` handles both Error objects and other error types
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper try-catch with type checking
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: N/A (test utilities themselves)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Good JSDoc comments
- ✅ **Simplification**: No opportunities - code is already simple and clear

**API Helpers** (`tests/helpers/apiHelpers.ts`):

- ✅ **Complexity**: Very Low - Simple wrapper functions
- ✅ **Logic Correctness**: Correct
- ✅ **Edge Cases**: N/A - simple wrappers
- ✅ **Error Handling**: N/A - no error handling needed
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: N/A (test helpers)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Good JSDoc comments
- ✅ **Simplification**: No opportunities

**Mock Implementations** (`tests/mocks/*.ts`):

- ✅ **Complexity**: Low - Standard Jest mocks
- ✅ **Logic Correctness**: Correct mock implementations
- ✅ **Edge Cases**: Reset functions handle all mock methods
- ✅ **Error Handling**: N/A - mocks return resolved promises
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: N/A (test mocks)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Good JSDoc comments
- ✅ **Simplification**: No opportunities

**Fixtures** (`tests/fixtures/*.ts`):

- ✅ **Complexity**: Very Low - Data structures only
- ✅ **Logic Correctness**: Correct fixture data
- ✅ **Edge Cases**: Factory functions allow overrides
- ✅ **Error Handling**: N/A - no logic
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: N/A (test data)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Good JSDoc comments
- ✅ **Simplification**: No opportunities

#### 3. Complex Business Logic Assessment

**Result**: No complex business logic found.

**Reason**: The application is still in early development. The Rails-to-TypeScript conversion has not yet begun, so there are no services, controllers, or business logic components to review.

**Files Reviewed**:

- `src/index.ts` - Empty
- `src/controllers/` - Empty (only `.gitkeep`)
- `src/services/` - Empty (only `.gitkeep`)
- `src/models/` - Empty (only `.gitkeep`)
- `src/routes/` - Empty (only `.gitkeep`)

#### 4. Recommendations

1. **Defer Review**: This task should be revisited after Phase 2 (File-by-File Conversion) is complete, when actual business logic has been converted from Rails.

2. **Future Focus Areas**: Once business logic is implemented, focus on:
   - Telegram webhook processing logic
   - Cursor Runner API integration
   - Message processing and routing
   - Callback state management
   - Audio transcription/translation services
   - Tool routing and execution

3. **Current Code Quality**: The existing test utilities and mocks are well-structured, documented, and follow TypeScript best practices. No issues found.

#### 5. Task Status

- [x] Identify complex business logic sections - **None found (application not yet converted)**
- [x] Review logic correctness - **Reviewed test utilities; all correct**
- [x] Check for edge cases - **Edge cases properly handled in test utilities**
- [x] Review error handling in complex logic - **N/A (no complex logic)**
- [x] Check for test coverage - **N/A (no business logic to test)**
- [x] Document complex logic - **Documented current state**
- [x] Identify simplification opportunities - **No opportunities (code is already simple)**
- [x] Create review notes - **Completed (this section)**

### Conclusion

The task has been evaluated, but there is no complex business logic to review at this stage. The application structure is in place, but the actual conversion from Rails has not yet begun. The existing test utilities and mocks are well-written and require no changes.

**Next Steps**: This task should be marked as complete for the current state, but a follow-up review should be scheduled after Phase 2 conversion tasks are completed.

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
