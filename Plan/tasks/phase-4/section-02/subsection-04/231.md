# PHASE4-013: Review logging statements

**Section**: 2. Manual Code Review
**Subsection**: 2.4
**Task ID**: PHASE4-013

## Description

Review logging statements throughout the codebase to improve code quality and maintainability. This task focuses on auditing actual logging implementation in the source code, verifying logging best practices are followed, identifying inconsistencies, and ensuring logging statements meet quality standards. This complements PHASE3-019 (which reviewed logging practices during Phase 3) by performing a focused audit of logging statements in the implemented codebase.

## Context

This task is distinct from:

- **PHASE3-019**: Reviewed logging practices and best practices during Phase 3 (holistic review)
- **PHASE1-030 through PHASE1-035**: Created the logging infrastructure (logger configuration, wrapper, integration)
- **PHASE3-015**: Reviewed code style (including console.log usage)

**PHASE4-013** focuses specifically on:

- Auditing actual logging statements in implemented source code
- Verifying logging statements follow established patterns
- Identifying inconsistencies and quality issues in logging
- Ensuring logging statements meet production quality standards

## Architecture Reference

The application should use:

- **Logger utility wrapper** (`src/utils/logger.ts`) - Provides consistent `logger.info()`, `logger.error()`, `logger.warn()`, `logger.debug()` interface
- **Structured logging** - JSON format for production, human-readable for development
- **Log levels** - debug, info, warn, error matching Rails.logger patterns
- **Error logging** - Full stack traces for errors (matching Rails two-line pattern: error message first, then backtrace)

Reference files:

- `src/utils/logger.ts` - Logger utility wrapper (should exist after PHASE1-032)
- `src/config/logger.ts` - Logger configuration (should exist after PHASE1-031)
- `docs/architecture.md` - Architecture documentation with logging patterns
- `Plan/tasks/phase-3/section-03/subsection-05/PHASE3-019.md` - Logging practices review

## Rails Logging Patterns to Match

The jarek-va Rails application uses consistent logging patterns that should be matched:

### Error Logging Pattern (Two-Line Format)

Rails uses a two-line error logging pattern:

1. Error message: `Rails.logger.error("#{exception.class}: #{exception.message}")` or `Rails.logger.error("Error description: #{e.message}")`
2. Stack trace: `Rails.logger.error(exception.backtrace.join("\n"))`

**Rails Examples:**

- `jarek-va/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` (lines 10-11) - Standard error handler pattern
- `jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb` (lines 33-34, 47-48, 59-60, 71-72, 113-114, 147-148) - Service error logging
- `jarek-va/app/services/tool_router.rb` (lines 41-42) - Tool execution error logging
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` (lines 33-34, 91-92, 369-370) - Job error logging

### Info Logging Pattern

- `Rails.logger.info("Operation description: #{details}")` - For normal operations
- `jarek-va/app/services/tool_router.rb` (lines 9, 28, 38) - Tool registration and execution logging
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` (lines 20, 64, 72, 80, 218) - Job processing logging

### Warn Logging Pattern

- `Rails.logger.warn("Warning description")` - For warnings and deprecations
- `jarek-va/app/services/tool_router.rb` (line 16) - Unknown tool warnings
- `jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb` (lines 85, 193, 203) - Callback processing warnings

### Debug Logging Pattern

- `Rails.logger.debug { "Debug information" }` - For debug information (block form for performance)
- `jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb` (line 180) - Debug logging example

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: Code Quality Audit
- Section: 2. Manual Code Review
- Focus on identifying and fixing code quality issues
- Document all findings and improvements

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Related Tasks

- Previous: PHASE4-012
- Next: PHASE4-014

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts

### 3. SIMPLE REQUESTS/QUESTIONS/DATA OPERATIONS

**Description**: Tasks involving asking questions, requesting information, explanations, clarifications, database queries/updates, data manipulation, executing scripts/commands that don't create source code files, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The request was completed or the question was answered"

**Examples**:
- Answering questions
- Providing explanations
- Querying databases
- Reading/updating data
- Executing commands that don't create source code files
- Information gathering tasks

IMPORTANT: When updating system settings (SystemSetting model), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection.

IMPORTANT: When working with tasks (creating, querying, updating, or deleting tasks), you MUST use the cursor-runner-shared-sqlite MCP connection. The tasks table is in the shared SQLite database at /app/shared_db/shared.sqlite3.

Tasks Table Schema:

- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- prompt: TEXT NOT NULL (the task prompt/description to be executed)
- status: INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (task status enum: 0=ready, 1=complete, 2=archived, 3=backlogged)
- createdat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- updatedat: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- order: INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (lower numbers are processed first)
- uuid: TEXT (unique identifier, indexed)

Task Status Values:

- 0 = ready (ready to be processed by task operator)
- 1 = complete (task has been completed)
- 2 = archived (task has been archived)
- 3 = backlogged (task is in backlog, not ready for processing)

Task Management Examples:

- To create a ready task: INSERT INTO tasks (prompt, "order", status) VALUES ('your prompt here', 0, 0)
- To list ready tasks: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC
- To mark a task as complete: UPDATE tasks SET status = 1, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To archive a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 2, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To backlog a task: UPDATE tasks SET status = 3, updatedat = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?
- To get next ready task: SELECT \* FROM tasks WHERE status = 0 ORDER BY "order" ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1

The task operator agent (when enabled) automatically processes tasks with status = 0 (ready), sending the prompt to cursor-runner for execution.

IMPORTANT: When working with cursor-agents (creating, listing, getting status, or deleting agents), use the Python scripts in /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/ directory. These scripts communicate with the cursor-agents service over HTTP:

Agent Management:

- To list all agents: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_agents.py
- To get agent status: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_agent_status.py --name <agent-name>
- To create an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/create_agent.py --name <name> --target-url <url> [options]
  - Use --queue <queue-name> to assign the agent to a specific queue (defaults to "default" if not specified)
  - Use --schedule <cron-pattern> for recurring agents (e.g., "0 8 \* \* \*" for daily at 8 AM)
  - Use --one-time for one-time agents that run immediately
- To delete an agent: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_agent.py --name <agent-name>

Queue Management:

- To list all queues: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/list_queues.py
- To get queue info: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/get_queue_info.py --queue-name <queue-name>
- To delete an empty queue: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/delete_queue.py --queue-name <queue-name>
  - Note: Cannot delete the "default" queue or queues with active jobs

Task Operator Management:

- To enable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/enable_task_operator.py [--queue <queue-name>]
  - The task operator automatically processes tasks from the tasks table in the database
  - It checks for incomplete tasks (lowest order first) and sends them to cursor-runner
  - Automatically re-enqueues itself every 5 seconds while enabled
- To disable the task operator: python3 /cursor/tools/cursor-agents/disable_task_operator.py
  - Sets the task_operator system setting to false, stopping re-enqueueing

When creating an agent, the target URL should be the cursor-runner docker networked URL (http://cursor-runner:3001/cursor/iterate/async) with a prompt that this agent will later execute.

Queue Organization: Agents can be organized into queues to avoid queue bloat. By default, agents are created in the "default" queue. Use descriptive queue names like "daily-tasks", "hourly-sync", or "urgent-jobs" to group related agents together.

IMPORTANT: When creating one-time scripts (shell scripts, Python scripts, etc.), place them in /cursor/scripts. This directory is shared and persistent across container restarts. Do not create scripts in the repository directories or other temporary locations.
