# PHASE4-002: Review and validate Prettier configuration for code formatting

**Section**: 1. Automated Code Smell Detection
**Subsection**: 1.2
**Task ID**: PHASE4-002

## Description

Review and validate the existing Prettier configuration for code formatting to ensure optimal code quality and maintainability. Prettier is already configured with ESLint integration, so this task focuses on validating the configuration, identifying any gaps or improvements, and ensuring it's properly documented.

## Current State

Prettier is already configured with:

- Prettier package installed (^3.1.1) as a dev dependency (allows compatible versions like 3.6.2)
- Configuration file: `.prettierrc.json` with standard TypeScript/Node.js settings
- Ignore patterns: `.prettierignore` file excluding node_modules, dist, coverage, logs, and env files
- ESLint integration via `eslint-config-prettier` and `eslint-plugin-prettier` (configured in `.eslintrc.json`)
- Format scripts in package.json (`format` and `format:check`)
- Integration with lint-staged for pre-commit formatting (configured in package.json `lint-staged` section)
- All current files pass Prettier formatting checks (`npm run format:check` passes successfully)
- **Note**: No CI/CD pipeline configuration found - CI/CD checklist item should note this

## Checklist

- [ ] Review existing Prettier configuration (`.prettierrc.json`)
- [ ] Verify Prettier configuration matches project style and best practices
- [ ] Validate that Prettier integration with ESLint is properly configured (no conflicts)
- [ ] Review Prettier ignore patterns (`.prettierignore`) for completeness
- [ ] Run Prettier format check on entire codebase and review output
- [ ] Verify Prettier scripts in package.json are correct and complete
- [ ] Check that lint-staged integration works correctly
- [ ] Verify Prettier runs correctly in CI/CD pipeline (if applicable)
  - **Note**: No GitHub Actions workflows found in `.github/workflows/` - document this finding
  - If CI/CD exists, verify Prettier format check runs in the pipeline
- [ ] Test Prettier formatting on sample files to ensure it works as expected
  - Test formatting on TypeScript files in `src/` and `tests/` directories
  - Verify formatting behavior matches configuration
- [ ] Review Prettier configuration against TypeScript/Node.js best practices
  - Check current settings: semi, trailingComma, singleQuote, printWidth, tabWidth, useTabs, arrowParens, endOfLine
  - Verify settings align with project conventions and TypeScript/Node.js community standards
- [ ] Identify any missing Prettier options that should be added
  - Review Prettier documentation for additional options that might benefit the project
  - Consider options like `bracketSpacing`, `bracketSameLine`, `proseWrap`, etc.
- [ ] Document Prettier configuration and usage guidelines
  - Create or update documentation (e.g., in `docs/` directory or README)
  - Document how to run Prettier (`npm run format`, `npm run format:check`)
  - Explain Prettier configuration options and their purposes
  - Document integration with ESLint and lint-staged
  - Include examples of common formatting scenarios
  - Note: No Prettier-specific documentation currently exists in `docs/` directory
- [ ] Fix any formatting issues found during review

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: Code Quality Audit
- Section: 1. Automated Code Smell Detection
- Focus on identifying and fixing code quality issues
- Document all findings and improvements

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
