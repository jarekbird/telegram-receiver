# PHASE4-006: Identify unused code/dead code

**Section**: 1. Automated Code Smell Detection
**Subsection**: 1.6
**Task ID**: PHASE4-006

## Description

Run comprehensive unused code and dead code detection to identify unused imports, functions, variables, types, and interfaces that impact code quality and maintainability. This task focuses on detecting code that is no longer referenced or used anywhere in the codebase, helping to reduce technical debt and improve code clarity.

## Current State

The project currently has:

- **TypeScript compiler** configured with `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` enabled in tsconfig.json
- **ESLint** configured with `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` rule (PHASE4-001)
- **Prettier** configured for code formatting (PHASE4-002)
- Basic linting and formatting scripts in package.json

**Existing Unused Code Detection**:

- TypeScript compiler flags unused local variables and parameters at compile time
- ESLint catches unused variables with the `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` rule
- Both tools provide basic detection but may miss:
  - Unused exports (functions/types exported but never imported)
  - Unused files/modules
  - Unused dependencies in package.json
  - Dead code paths (unreachable code)
  - Unused type definitions and interfaces

**Missing**: Comprehensive unused code detection that provides:

- Identification of unused exports across the entire codebase
- Detection of unused files and modules
- Analysis of unused dependencies
- Detection of dead code paths
- Integration with existing tooling (TypeScript, ESLint)
- Automated unused code reporting
- Prioritization of unused code by impact

## Tool Options

Consider the following options for unused code detection:

1. **ts-prune** (Recommended for TypeScript)
   - Finds unused exports in TypeScript projects
   - Fast and lightweight
   - Can be integrated into npm scripts
   - Free and actively maintained
   - Supports ignore patterns
   - Provides JSON output for automation

2. **unimported** (Recommended for comprehensive analysis)
   - Finds unused files, dependencies, and exports
   - Analyzes both TypeScript and JavaScript
   - Detects unused npm dependencies
   - Can auto-fix some issues
   - Free and actively maintained
   - Provides detailed reports

3. **depcheck** (For dependency analysis)
   - Finds unused npm dependencies
   - Detects missing dependencies
   - Can be integrated into CI/CD
   - Free and actively maintained
   - Works well with other tools

4. **eslint-plugin-unused-imports** (ESLint plugin)
   - Detects unused imports
   - Can auto-fix unused imports
   - Integrates with existing ESLint setup
   - Free and actively maintained
   - Works alongside existing ESLint rules

5. **knip** (Comprehensive TypeScript/JavaScript analyzer)
   - Finds unused files, dependencies, exports, and types
   - Very comprehensive analysis
   - Supports monorepos
   - Can detect dead code paths
   - Free and actively maintained
   - More complex setup but very thorough

6. **TypeScript compiler analysis**
   - Use `tsc --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` for basic detection
   - Already configured in tsconfig.json
   - Limited to local scope analysis

## Detection Scope

Unused code detection should cover:

1. **Unused Imports**
   - Imported modules/functions/types that are never used
   - Default imports that are unused
   - Namespace imports that are unused

2. **Unused Exports**
   - Exported functions that are never imported elsewhere
   - Exported types/interfaces that are never used
   - Exported constants that are never referenced
   - Exported classes that are never instantiated

3. **Unused Variables**
   - Local variables declared but never used
   - Function parameters that are never referenced
   - Class properties that are never accessed
   - Enum values that are never used

4. **Unused Types/Interfaces**
   - Type definitions that are never referenced
   - Interfaces that are never implemented or used
   - Type aliases that are never used
   - Generic type parameters that are unused

5. **Unused Files**
   - Source files that are never imported
   - Test files for non-existent source files
   - Configuration files that are not referenced

6. **Unused Dependencies**
   - npm packages in package.json that are never imported
   - Dev dependencies that are not used
   - Peer dependencies that are not needed

7. **Dead Code Paths**
   - Unreachable code after return statements
   - Code after throw statements
   - Unreachable code in conditionals

  - Unused files
  - Unused dependencies
  - Unused types/interfaces
  - Dead code paths
- [ ] Document all significant unused code:
  - File locations and line numbers
  - Type of unused code (export, import, variable, type, etc.)
  - Reason for being unused (if apparent)
  - Impact of removal (breaking changes, dependencies, etc.)
  - Suggested removal approach
- [ ] Create prioritized list of unused code issues:
  - Critical: Unused dependencies (bloat package.json)

  - Total unused files found
  - Total unused dependencies found
  - Total unused types/interfaces found
  - Most unused files (top 10)
- [ ] Create unused code report document (markdown or HTML)
- [ ] Identify false positives (code that appears unused but is actually used):
  - Dynamic imports
  - Reflection-based usage
  - Framework-specific usage patterns
  - Test-only code

### Cleanup Plan

## Configuration Example (ts-prune)

Add to package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "unused:exports": "ts-prune",
    "unused:exports:json": "ts-prune --json > reports/unused-exports.json"
  }
}
```

Run with entry points:

```bash
ts-prune --project tsconfig.json
```

## Configuration Example (unimported)

Create `.unimportedrc.json`:

```json
{
  "entry": ["src/index.ts", "src/**/*.ts"],
  "ignorePatterns": ["node_modules", "dist", "coverage", "*.test.ts", "*.spec.ts"],
  "ignoreUnusedDependencies": ["@types/node", "@types/jest"]
}
```

Add to package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "unused:all": "unimported",
    "unused:files": "unimported --init"
  }
}
```

## Configuration Example (eslint-plugin-unused-imports)

Update `.eslintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint", "prettier", "unused-imports"],
  "rules": {
    "unused-imports/no-unused-imports": "error",
    "unused-imports/no-unused-vars": [
      "warn",
      {
        "vars": "all",
        "varsIgnorePattern": "^_",
        "args": "after-used",
        "argsIgnorePattern": "^_"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration Example (depcheck)

Create `.depcheckrc.json`:

```json
{
  "ignoreMatches": ["@types/*", "eslint-*", "prettier", "typescript", "ts-node", "nodemon"],
  "ignorePatterns": ["dist", "coverage", "*.test.ts"]
}
```

Add to package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "unused:deps": "depcheck"
  }
}
```

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: Code Quality Audit
- Section: 1. Automated Code Smell Detection
- Focus on identifying and fixing code quality issues
- Document all findings and improvements
- Unused code detection should complement, not replace, code reviews
- Some "unused" code may be intentionally kept (e.g., public API exports, test utilities)
- Be careful with false positives - verify that code is truly unused before removal
- Consider the impact of removing unused exports (may break external consumers)
- Start with safe removals (unused imports, unused local variables)
- Use multiple tools for comprehensive coverage (ts-prune + unimported + ESLint)
- Integration with existing TypeScript and ESLint configuration provides the most comprehensive analysis
- Consider both development and production code when analyzing unused dependencies
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent

## Related Tasks

- Next: PHASE4-007

## Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria for task completion. The review agent uses these definitions to evaluate whether a task has been completed successfully.

### 1. CODE/FILE WRITING TASKS

**Description**: Tasks that involve writing, creating, modifying, or implementing SOURCE CODE FILES that need to be committed to git.

**Definition of Done**: "A Pull Request was created OR code was pushed to origin with the task complete"

**Examples**:
- Creating new source code files
- Modifying existing source code files
- Implementing features, functions, classes, modules
- Writing tests, specs
- Refactoring code
- Fixing bugs in source code

### 2. SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASKS

**Description**: Tasks involving installing dependencies, running builds, installing packages, running migrations, executing install scripts, etc.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete

**Examples**:
- Installing npm packages, pip packages, gem dependencies
- Running database migrations
- Building/compiling projects
- Setting up development environments
- Running install scripts
