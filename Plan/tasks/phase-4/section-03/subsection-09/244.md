# PHASE4-026: Create code quality metrics dashboard

**Section**: 3. Refactoring
**Subsection**: 3.9
**Task ID**: PHASE4-026

## Description

Create a comprehensive code quality metrics dashboard to track and visualize code quality metrics, improve code quality, and maintainability. This dashboard should aggregate metrics from various code quality tools (Jest coverage, ESLint, complexity analysis, duplication detection) and present them in a clear, actionable format.

This task implements the "Code metrics dashboard" deliverable specified in Phase 4: Code Quality Audit (CONVERSION_STEPS.md). The dashboard should provide visibility into code quality trends and help identify areas for improvement.

## Scope

This task covers:

- Setting up automated metrics collection from existing tools (Jest coverage, ESLint)
- Integrating complexity analysis (ESLint built-in complexity rules, standalone tools, or SonarQube metrics)
- Integrating duplication detection tools (e.g., jscpd - see PHASE4-005)
- Reusing metrics from related Phase 4 tasks (PHASE4-004 for complexity, PHASE4-005 for duplication)
- Calculating maintainability index
- Creating a dashboard (markdown report or web-based) that aggregates all metrics
- Adding visualizations (charts, graphs, tables) for metrics
- Documenting the dashboard and how to use it
- Setting up automated generation (via npm scripts or CI/CD)

## Checklist

### Set Up Metrics Collection Infrastructure

- [ ] Review existing code quality tools:
  - Jest coverage (already configured in `jest.config.ts`)
  - ESLint (already configured in `.eslintrc.json`)
  - Prettier (already configured)
- [ ] Set up complexity analysis:
  - **Option A**: Use ESLint built-in complexity rules (recommended - no additional package needed)
    - ESLint has built-in `complexity` rule (not a plugin) - configure in `.eslintrc.json`
    - Add `complexity: ["warn", 10]` and related rules (`max-depth`, `max-lines-per-function`, `max-params`)
    - See PHASE4-004 for ESLint complexity configuration details
  - **Option B**: Install standalone complexity analysis tool
    - Install `complexity-report` or `ts-complexity` package
    - Set up script to run complexity analysis
  - **Option C**: Use SonarQube complexity metrics (if PHASE4-003 completed)
    - Extract complexity data from SonarQube reports
- [ ] Install duplication detection tool:
  - Install `jscpd` (JavaScript Copy/Paste Detector) package
  - Configure jscpd for TypeScript files
  - Set up script to run duplication detection
- [ ] Set up metrics collection script:
  - Create script to collect all metrics (coverage, complexity, duplication, ESLint)
  - Aggregate metrics into a single JSON/data structure
  - Handle errors gracefully if tools are unavailable

### Collect Code Coverage Metrics

- [ ] Extract code coverage data from Jest:
  - Use existing `npm run test:coverage` output
  - Parse coverage data from available formats:
    - **Primary**: Parse `coverage/lcov.info` (LCOV format - always generated by Jest)
    - **Alternative**: If JSON format needed, add `'json-summary'` or `'json'` to `coverageReporters` in `jest.config.ts`, then parse `coverage/coverage-summary.json`
  - Extract key metrics:
    - Overall coverage percentage
    - Line coverage
    - Statement coverage
    - Branch coverage
    - Function coverage
    - Per-file coverage breakdown
- [ ] Calculate coverage trends (if historical data available)
- [ ] Identify files with low coverage (<80% threshold)

### Collect Complexity Metrics

- [ ] Run complexity analysis on source code:
  - **If using ESLint complexity rules**: Run `npm run lint` and parse ESLint output for complexity violations
  - **If using standalone tool**: Execute complexity analysis tool on `src/` directory
  - **If using SonarQube**: Extract complexity metrics from SonarQube reports (if PHASE4-003 completed)
  - Analyze cyclomatic complexity per function/method
  - Identify functions with high complexity (>10 threshold)
  - Calculate average complexity per file
  - Calculate overall project complexity
- [ ] Extract complexity data:
  - Functions/methods exceeding complexity thresholds
  - Files with high average complexity
  - Complexity distribution across the codebase
  - **Note**: If PHASE4-004 (Run complexity analysis) has been completed, reuse complexity reports/data from that task
- [ ] Categorize complexity levels (low, medium, high, very high)

### Collect Duplication Metrics

- [ ] Run duplication detection:
  - **If PHASE4-005 completed**: Reuse duplication reports/data from PHASE4-005 (jscpd reports, SonarQube duplication metrics)
  - **If PHASE4-005 not completed**: Set up and run duplication detection:
    - Execute jscpd on `src/` directory
    - Configure jscpd for TypeScript files (see PHASE4-005 for configuration details)
    - Set appropriate similarity threshold (e.g., 80%)
- [ ] Extract duplication data:
  - Overall duplication percentage
  - Number of duplicate blocks
  - Duplicate code locations (file paths and line numbers)
  - Size of duplicate blocks
- [ ] Identify largest duplicate blocks for prioritization

### Calculate Maintainability Index

- [ ] Research maintainability index calculation:
  - Use standard formula: MI = 171 - 5.2 _ ln(Halstead Volume) - 0.23 _ (Cyclomatic Complexity) - 16.2 \* ln(Lines of Code)
  - Or use simplified version based on available metrics
- [ ] Calculate maintainability index:
  - Per file maintainability index
  - Overall project maintainability index
  - Categorize maintainability levels (excellent, good, fair, poor)
- [ ] Identify files with low maintainability index

### Collect ESLint Metrics

- [ ] Run ESLint analysis:
  - Execute `npm run lint` and capture output
  - Parse ESLint results (errors, warnings)
  - Extract metrics:
    - Total number of errors
    - Total number of warnings
    - Errors/warnings by rule
    - Errors/warnings by file
- [ ] Categorize issues by severity and type

### Create Metrics Dashboard

- [ ] Design dashboard structure:
  - Overview section with key metrics summary
  - Detailed sections for each metric type
  - Visualizations (charts, graphs, tables)
  - File-level breakdown
  - Recommendations/action items
- [ ] Choose dashboard format:
  - Option A: Markdown report (static, version-controlled)
  - Option B: HTML dashboard (interactive, can be served)
  - Option C: Both (markdown for docs, HTML for interactive viewing)
- [ ] Implement dashboard:
  - Create dashboard template/structure
  - Populate with collected metrics
  - Add visualizations (use libraries like Chart.js, or generate static charts)
  - Format metrics clearly with appropriate units and thresholds
- [ ] Add metrics interpretation:
  - Define what each metric means
  - Set quality thresholds (e.g., coverage >80%, complexity <10)
  - Provide recommendations based on metrics

### Create Visualizations

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: Code Quality Audit
- Section: 3. Refactoring
- Subsection: 3.9
- This task implements the "Code metrics dashboard" deliverable specified in Phase 4 (CONVERSION_STEPS.md line 201)
- Focus on creating a comprehensive dashboard that aggregates metrics from multiple code quality tools
- The dashboard should provide actionable insights to improve code quality and maintainability
- Leverage existing infrastructure:
  - Jest coverage is already configured (`jest.config.ts`)
  - ESLint is already configured (`.eslintrc.json`)
  - Coverage reports are generated in `coverage/` directory
- Consider integration with Phase 4 tasks:
  - **PHASE4-004**: Run complexity analysis (can reuse complexity metrics and reports)
  - **PHASE4-005**: Code duplication detection (can reuse duplication metrics and jscpd reports)
  - **PHASE4-003**: SonarQube setup (if completed, can extract metrics from SonarQube reports)
  - Other Phase 4 tasks that generate quality metrics
- Dashboard format considerations:
  - Markdown: Easy to version control, readable in GitHub/GitLab
  - HTML: More interactive, better for visualizations
  - Consider generating both formats
- Metrics thresholds (suggested):
  - Code coverage: >80% (aligned with jarek-va target)
  - Cyclomatic complexity: <10 per function (aligned with jarek-va RuboCop config)
  - Duplication: <3% (industry standard)
  - Maintainability index: >70 (good), >85 (excellent)
- Tools to consider:
  - **Complexity analysis**:
    - ESLint built-in `complexity` rule (recommended - no additional package, see PHASE4-004)
    - `complexity-report` or `ts-complexity` as standalone alternatives
    - SonarQube complexity metrics (if PHASE4-003 completed)
  - **Duplication detection**:
    - `jscpd` for duplication detection (recommended, supports TypeScript, see PHASE4-005)
    - `plato` or `jsinspect` as alternative duplication tools
    - SonarQube duplication detection (if PHASE4-003 completed)
- Automation is important: Dashboard should be easy to regenerate with `npm run metrics:dashboard`
- Historical tracking: Consider storing metrics over time to show trends (optional enhancement)

- Task can be completed independently by a single agent
