# PHASE4-019: Simplify complex logic

**Section**: 3. Refactoring
**Subsection**: 3.2
**Task ID**: PHASE4-019

## Description

Simplify complex logic to improve code quality and maintainability. This task focuses on systematically addressing complex logic identified through complexity analysis (PHASE4-004), complex business logic review (PHASE4-010), automated code quality reports (PHASE4-009), and manual code review findings (PHASE4-017). The goal is to improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce cognitive complexity by breaking down complex functions, simplifying conditional logic, extracting helper functions, and improving algorithm clarity.

## Current State

**Important**: This task should be executed **after Phase 2 conversion** when actual business logic has been implemented. If the application is still in early development with minimal source code, this task should focus on preparation and setup rather than simplification.

Complex logic may have been identified through:

- **PHASE4-004**: Complexity analysis (cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity metrics) - **May not be completed yet**
- **PHASE4-010**: Complex business logic review (`docs/manual-code-review.md`) - **Completed**
- **PHASE4-009**: Automated code quality report (`docs/code-quality-report.md`) - **May not exist yet**
- **PHASE4-017**: Manual code review report (`docs/manual-code-review.md`) - **Completed**

**Manual Code Review Findings** (from PHASE4-017):

- PHASE4-010 found **no complex business logic** at the time of review (early development stage)
- Application is in early development - complex logic may emerge after Phase 2 conversion
- Test utilities reviewed: Low complexity, well-structured
- **Current state**: `src/index.ts` is empty, no business logic implemented yet

**Complexity Analysis Findings** (if PHASE4-004 is completed):

- Check complexity analysis reports for functions with:
  - Cyclomatic complexity > 10 (high complexity)
  - Cyclomatic complexity > 20 (critical complexity)
  - Cognitive complexity > 15 (high cognitive load)
- **Note**: ESLint complexity rules are currently **NOT enabled** in `.eslintrc.json`. If complexity analysis hasn't been run, enable ESLint complexity rules first (see PHASE4-004)
- Check ESLint complexity rule violations: `npm run lint` (will only work if complexity rules are enabled)
- Review files with highest average complexity scores

**Automated Findings** (if PHASE4-009 is completed):

- Check `docs/code-quality-report.md` for consolidated complexity findings - **File may not exist yet**
- Review SonarQube reports (if configured) for complexity metrics

**If No Complex Logic Exists** (Current State):

- If no complex logic has been identified (e.g., early development stage, no business logic implemented):
  - Complete preparation steps (enable complexity analysis, set up tooling)
  - Document that no complex logic exists at this time
  - Mark task as ready for execution after Phase 2 conversion
  - Set up complexity monitoring for future code

**Complex Logic Indicators**:

1. **High Cyclomatic Complexity**: Functions with many decision points (>10)
2. **High Cognitive Complexity**: Functions that are difficult to understand (>15)
3. **Deep Nesting**: Nested conditionals exceeding 4 levels
4. **Long Functions**: Functions exceeding 50 lines with complex logic
5. **Complex Conditionals**: Multiple boolean conditions, nested ternaries, complex switch statements
6. **Complex Algorithms**: Algorithms with multiple steps, state management, or intricate logic flows
7. **God Functions**: Functions that do too many things

## Checklist

### Preparation and Prioritization

- [ ] **If no complex logic exists yet** (early development stage):

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 4: Code Quality Audit
- Section: 3. Refactoring
- **Execution Timing**: This task should be executed **after Phase 2 conversion** when actual business logic has been implemented. If the application is still in early development, focus on preparation and setup.
- Focus on systematically addressing complex logic identified in previous tasks
- Document all findings and improvements
- **Important**: Always run tests after each simplification to ensure no functionality is broken
- **Important**: Simplification should improve code quality without changing behavior
- **Important**: If complexity analysis (PHASE4-004) is not available, work with manual review findings (PHASE4-017) and enable ESLint complexity rules
- **Important**: If no complex logic exists (current state), document this and set up complexity monitoring for future code
- **Important**: ESLint complexity rules are currently NOT enabled - enable them if complexity analysis hasn't been run (see PHASE4-004)
- Start with high-impact, low-risk simplifications
- Consider dependencies between complex logic sections (some may need to be simplified together)
- Not all complexity is bad - some algorithms are inherently complex. Focus on reducing unnecessary complexity and improving clarity
- Use descriptive names to reduce cognitive load - a well-named function is better than a comment
- Extract helper functions even if they're only used once if it improves readability
- Early returns and guard clauses are powerful tools for reducing nesting
- Complex conditionals can often be simplified using lookup tables, maps, or strategy patterns
- Task can be completed independently by a single agent, but may require multiple iterations if many complex logic sections are identified
- **Current State**: Application is in early development - `src/index.ts` is empty, no business logic implemented. Manual code review found no complex business logic. Task should be revisited after Phase 2 conversion.
