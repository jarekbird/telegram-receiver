# PHASE4-023: Optimize performance bottlenecks

**Section**: 3. Refactoring
**Subsection**: 3.6
**Task ID**: PHASE4-023

## Description

Optimize performance bottlenecks identified during Phase 3 performance review and any additional bottlenecks discovered during Phase 4 code quality audit. This task focuses on implementing optimizations to improve response times, reduce memory usage, optimize database/Redis queries, and fix performance bottlenecks that impact code quality and maintainability.

This task builds on the performance review work completed in Phase 3 (PHASE3-029 through PHASE3-035) and addresses any remaining or newly identified performance issues as part of the Phase 4 code quality audit.

## Scope

This task covers:

- Reviewing performance findings from Phase 3 performance review tasks
- Identifying any additional performance bottlenecks through code analysis
- Optimizing slow database/Redis queries
- Optimizing inefficient algorithms and data structures
- Implementing caching strategies where beneficial
- Optimizing memory usage and fixing memory leaks
- Reducing unnecessary computations and redundant operations
- Verifying performance improvements through testing
- Documenting all optimizations and their impact

**Note**: This task focuses on performance optimizations that improve code quality. For comprehensive performance optimization, refer to PHASE3-035 (Optimize identified performance issues).

## Context from Phase 3

Phase 3 performance review tasks (PHASE3-029 through PHASE3-035) identified performance issues in:

- Redis query patterns and connection management
- Database query efficiency
- API response times
- External API call patterns (Telegram, Cursor Runner, ElevenLabs)
- Asynchronous operation patterns
- Memory usage and potential leaks
- Caching strategies

This task addresses any remaining issues or newly discovered bottlenecks.

## Rails Implementation Reference

For reference, the following Rails files demonstrate expected performance patterns and optimization strategies that should be maintained or improved in the TypeScript implementation:

### Performance-Critical Components

- **TelegramController** (`jarek-va/app/controllers/telegram_controller.rb`):
  - Webhook endpoint returns `head :ok` immediately after enqueueing job (line 25)
  - Job enqueueing happens synchronously but quickly (< 50ms expected)
  - Error handling sends messages asynchronously (fire-and-forget pattern)
  - Admin endpoints make synchronous Telegram API calls (response time depends on Telegram API latency)

- **TelegramMessageJob** (`jarek-va/app/jobs/telegram_message_job.rb`):
  - Background job processing (not part of API response time)
  - Audio transcription happens in background job
  - File cleanup happens in ensure blocks (lines 342-350, 379-387)
  - Cursor runner forwarding uses async iterate method (line 209)
  - Redis state storage happens synchronously but quickly (lines 190-201)

- **CursorRunnerCallbackController** (`jarek-va/app/controllers/cursor_runner_callback_controller.rb`):
  - Callback processing returns 200 OK quickly (line 42)
  - Redis state retrieval happens synchronously (line 30)
  - Telegram message sending happens after response is sent (fire-and-forget pattern, lines 186-212)
  - Audio file generation and cleanup happens synchronously but in background context (lines 221-254)

- **CursorRunnerCallbackService** (`jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_callback_service.rb`):
  - Redis operations use simple GET/SET/DEL patterns (lines 30, 39, 55)
  - TTL-based cleanup using `setex` (line 30)
  - Single Redis connection per service instance (lines 15-22)
  - JSON serialization/deserialization for stored data (lines 30, 42)

- **TelegramService** (`jarek-va/app/services/telegram_service.rb`):
  - Uses Telegram::Bot::Client which handles HTTP connection pooling internally (line 11)
  - File downloads use Faraday with streaming (lines 90-186)
  - Error handling doesn't block request processing
  - HTML entity escaping happens synchronously (lines 20-24)

- **CursorRunnerService** (`jarek-va/app/services/cursor_runner_service.rb`):
  - Uses Net::HTTP with timeout configuration (lines 16-19)
  - Connection pooling handled by Net::HTTP (reuses connections)
  - Timeout handling for long-running operations (lines 16-19)
  - Async iterate method supports callback URLs (lines 51-66)

### Key Performance Patterns from Rails Implementation:

1. **Immediate Webhook Acknowledgment**: Telegram webhook returns 200 OK immediately after enqueueing job, processing happens asynchronously.

2. **Redis Connection Management**: Single Redis connection per service instance, simple GET/SET/DEL operations with TTL-based cleanup.

3. **Background Job Processing**: Heavy operations (audio transcription, message processing) happen in background jobs, not blocking API responses.

4. **Fire-and-Forget Telegram Messages**: Telegram messages sent after callback response is returned, not blocking the callback endpoint.

5. **File Cleanup**: Audio files cleaned up in ensure blocks to prevent memory leaks and disk space issues.

6. **Connection Reuse**: HTTP clients (Telegram::Bot::Client, Net::HTTP) handle connection pooling internally.

7. **Error Handling**: Errors don't block responses - always return appropriate status codes even on errors.

8. **Synchronous Redis Operations**: Redis operations are synchronous but fast (< 50ms expected), acceptable for callback processing.

### Optimization Targets Based on Rails Patterns:

- **Webhook Response Time**: < 200ms (matches Rails pattern of immediate acknowledgment)
- **Job Enqueueing**: < 50ms (matches Rails Sidekiq enqueueing time)
- **Redis Operations**: < 50ms per operation (matches Rails Redis operation times)
- **Callback Response Time**: < 500ms (matches Rails callback processing time)
- **Health Check**: < 10ms (matches Rails simple health check pattern)
